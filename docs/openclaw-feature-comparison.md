# OpenClaw vs CoWork OS Feature Comparison

This document compares the features shown in the provided comparison list against the current evidence available in the **CoWork OS** repository and the **OpenClaw** repository.

## Scope

Compared features:

- Memory system
- Memory size
- Memory nudges
- Memory flush
- Memory injection security
- Skill system
- Skill standard
- Autonomous skill creation
- Reflective learning loop
- Skill security scanning
- Session history search
- Cross-session user modeling
- Cache-stable memory

## Summary

High level:

- **OpenClaw** appears stronger on plain-markdown workspace memory and public skill registry/discovery.
- **CoWork OS** appears stronger on structured memory architecture, the `Subconscious` reflective loop, approval-gated skill creation, built-in governance/security controls, and now a shared turn kernel / tool scheduler / orchestration graph stack for delegated work.
- Some items in the screenshot are not first-class product terms in either repo, so a few rows are marked **Partial** or **Unclear**.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | CoWork OS | OpenClaw | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Memory system | Yes | Yes | CoWork OS now has layered memory with curated hot memory, archive recall, session recall, topic packs, knowledge graph, workspace kit, and imported ChatGPT history. OpenClaw uses workspace markdown memory files such as `MEMORY.md` and `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. |
| Memory size | Partial / not explicit | Partial / not explicit | Neither repo clearly presents a specific memory-capacity feature or configurable marketed size in the reviewed docs. Both focus more on compaction and management. |
| Memory nudges | Partial | Yes | CoWork OS has failure-pattern nudges and proactive reminder-style behavior via memory/persona systems, but not a clearly named “memory nudge” feature. OpenClaw explicitly references heartbeat nudges. |
| Memory flush | Yes | Yes | CoWork OS flushes compaction summaries into durable memory. OpenClaw documents automatic pre-compaction memory flush and silent memory flush to disk. |
| Memory injection security | Partial | Partial | Both have adjacent controls, but not necessarily under this exact label. CoWork OS documents sanitization, privacy protection, prompt hardening, and memory controls. OpenClaw documents trust boundaries and explicitly treats prompt-injection-only findings as out of scope without a boundary bypass. |
| Skill system | Yes | Yes | Both repos clearly support reusable skills. |
| Skill standard | Yes | Yes | CoWork OS has a documented skill quality specification. OpenClaw has a documented skill bundle structure centered on `SKILL.md` plus registry metadata. |
| Autonomous skill creation | Partial, approval-gated | Partial / unclear | CoWork OS supports `skill_proposal.create` but requires approval before a skill is materialized. OpenClaw supports publish/install/discovery flows, but reviewed docs do not clearly show autonomous self-authoring by the agent. |
| Reflective learning loop | Yes | Partial | CoWork OS has explicit subconscious-loop documentation, reinforcement loops, correction capture, and `memory_save`. OpenClaw has learning references, but not as clearly productized in the reviewed sources. |
| Skill security scanning | Yes | Partial | CoWork OS documents skill validation/audit tooling. OpenClaw shows install gating and unsafe-skill reporting, but no equally explicit skill scan pipeline was found in the reviewed material. |
| Session history search | Yes | Yes | CoWork OS supports explicit recent-run recall through `search_sessions` plus archive/global retrieval. OpenClaw includes a dedicated sessions history tool. |
| Cross-session user modeling | Yes | Partial | CoWork OS has relationship memory, user profile extraction, and adaptive style/personalization. OpenClaw has personal assistant and profile/persona concepts, but less explicit structured cross-session user modeling in the reviewed docs. |
| Cache-stable memory | Yes | Yes | CoWork OS now documents provider-aware stable-prefix prompt caching driven by session-scoped prompt sections and persisted prompt-cache state. OpenClaw explicitly documents cache-stable prompt behavior by keeping the time-zone section stable. |

## Detailed Notes by Feature

### 1. Memory system

**CoWork OS**

- README describes a persistent memory system, knowledge graph, relationship memory, workspace kit, and ChatGPT history import.
- `docs/features.md` describes hybrid `search_memories`, memory compression, privacy protection, and auto-capture.
- `docs/architecture.md` points to `MemoryService`, `RelationshipMemoryService`, `UserProfileService`, and workspace kit indexing.

**OpenClaw**

- `docs/concepts/memory.md` states that memory is plain Markdown in the agent workspace.
- Default layout includes `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and optional `MEMORY.md`.

### 2. Memory size

Neither repo, in the reviewed sources, positions “memory size” as a clear feature with a concrete product-level quota or configurable marketed capacity.

- CoWork OS focuses on compaction, compression, hybrid retrieval, and flush behavior.
- OpenClaw focuses on compaction, session summaries, and memory flush to disk.

### 3. Memory nudges

**CoWork OS**

- Has adjacent behavior rather than a directly named memory-nudge feature.
- `docs/changelog.md` mentions repeated-failure detection that nudges the agent to switch strategy.
- Relationship memory and proactive twin workflows also create reminder-like continuity behavior.

**OpenClaw**

- `docs/gateway/heartbeat.md` explicitly frames periodic heartbeat behavior and user-facing reminder-style routing.
- Repository search also surfaced explicit “nudge” references.

### 4. Memory flush

**CoWork OS**

- `docs/context-compaction.md` states that compaction summaries are flushed to `MemoryService` for cross-session recall.
- The same document describes pre-compaction flush and proactive compaction behavior.

**OpenClaw**

- `docs/concepts/memory.md` references automatic pre-compaction memory flush.
- `docs/concepts/compaction.md` states OpenClaw can run a silent memory flush turn to store durable notes to disk before compaction.

### 5. Memory injection security

This feature label is somewhat interpretation-dependent, so the comparison below is based on adjacent security controls.

**CoWork OS**

- `docs/security-guide.md` documents sanitization, prompt/skill hardening, validation, and protections around memory/context injection.
- `docs/subconscious-loop.md` documents durable evidence, critique, winner selection, and target-scoped reflection.
- Overall posture is governance-heavy: approvals, sandboxing, privacy-aware storage, and configurable guardrails.

**OpenClaw**

- `SECURITY.md` clearly says prompt-injection-only findings are out of scope unless they bypass an auth, policy, allowlist, approval, or sandbox boundary.
- OpenClaw documents trust boundaries and an explicit trusted-operator model rather than presenting “memory injection security” as a standalone feature.

### 6. Skill system

Both repos clearly have a real skill system.

**CoWork OS**

- README advertises 140 built-in skills.
- `resources/skills/` contains bundled skills.
- Plugin packs can expose and toggle individual skills.

**OpenClaw**

- README links directly to skills and onboarding around skills.
- `docs/tools/clawhub.md` describes the public skill registry, publishing, installation, and discovery.

### 7. Skill standard

**CoWork OS**

- `docs/skills-quality-spec.md` defines quality standards for bundled skills.
- Validation and audit commands are documented in `docs/development.md`.

**OpenClaw**

- `docs/tools/clawhub.md` describes a standardized skill-bundle model.
- Skills are represented as folders with `SKILL.md` plus supporting files and metadata.

### 8. Autonomous skill creation

**CoWork OS**

- Supports approval-gated skill creation via `skill_proposal.create`, `approve`, and `reject`.
- `docs/integration-skill-bootstrap-lifecycle.md` is explicit that proposals do not directly mutate skills without approval.

**OpenClaw**

- Supports creation/publishing in a broader ecosystem sense through ClawHub.
- However, in the reviewed docs, I did not find clear evidence of autonomous agent-authored skill creation as a first-class governed runtime feature.

### 9. Reflective learning loop

**CoWork OS**

- `docs/subconscious-loop.md` documents the reflective architecture and its learning substrate.
- Includes correction capture, playbook reinforcement, user preference learning, and agent-initiated `memory_save`.

**OpenClaw**

- Repository search shows references to learning and feedback flows.
- But the reviewed docs do not present an equally explicit, centralized architecture page comparable to CoWork OS's subconscious-loop design.

### 10. Skill security scanning

**CoWork OS**

- `docs/skills-quality-spec.md` and `docs/development.md` document validation and audit tooling:
  - `npm run skills:validate-routing`
  - `npm run skills:validate-content`
  - `npm run skills:audit`
  - `npm run skills:check`

**OpenClaw**

- `docs/tools/clawhub.md` includes unsafe-skill reporting and install/discovery flows.
- That is useful, but I did not find equally explicit repository-native skill scanning/audit commands in the reviewed material.

### 11. Session history search

**CoWork OS**

- `docs/features.md` documents unified archive search plus explicit session recall via `search_sessions`.
- `docs/workspace-memory-flow.md` documents transcript spans/checkpoints and tool-driven recall.

**OpenClaw**

- `src/agents/tools/sessions-history-tool.ts` is direct evidence of a dedicated session-history tool.
- `src/agents/tools/sessions-access.ts` defines session access controls around history/list/send behavior.

### 12. Cross-session user modeling

**CoWork OS**

- `docs/relationship-agent-architecture.md` and `docs/subconscious-loop.md` document relationship memory, user profile extraction, commitment tracking, and personalization.
- README also describes Adaptive Style Engine and related evolving-intelligence behavior.

**OpenClaw**

- README positions OpenClaw as a personal AI assistant and mentions profiles/persona-adjacent concepts in the repo.
- However, I did not find equally explicit structured cross-session user-modeling architecture in the reviewed subset.

### 13. Cache-stable memory

**CoWork OS**

- `docs/providers.md` documents default-on provider-aware prompt caching with stable system sections, volatile turn sections, Anthropic auto mode, and OpenRouter Claude explicit breakpoints.
- `docs/execution-runtime-model.md` documents stable-prefix prompt caching driven by session- vs turn-scoped prompt sections.
- `docs/session-runtime.md` documents persisted prompt-cache state including `stablePrefixHash`, tool-schema hash, provider family, and invalidation reason.

**OpenClaw**

- `docs/concepts/system-prompt.md` explicitly says the current date/time section is kept cache-stable by including only the time zone and not a dynamic clock.

## Verdict

If the goal is a feature-for-feature comparison against the provided list:

- **CoWork OS leads** on structured memory architecture, reflective learning, user modeling, approval-gated skill creation, and skill validation/audit.
- **OpenClaw leads** on public skill-registry/discovery workflows, simple workspace-native memory files, and heartbeat-style nudges.
- **Both** support core memory and skills, but they package these capabilities differently:
  - **CoWork OS** favors governance, structure, and production controls.
  - **OpenClaw** favors personal-assistant workflows, workspace-native simplicity, and extensible operator tooling.
