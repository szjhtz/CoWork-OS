# Digital Twin Personas

Digital Twin Personas are pre-built AI agent templates that create role-specific digital twins for team members. Each twin absorbs cognitively draining work — status reporting, PR triage, meeting prep, dependency tracking — so the human can stay in deep focus.

A persona template bundles everything needed: agent role configuration, Heartbeat v3 defaults, proactive tasks, recommended skills, a deep system prompt, and cognitive offload categories. Activating a template creates a fully configured agent in one click.

Access from **Settings** > **Digital Twins** or **Mission Control** > **Add Digital Twin**. For company-ops workflows, you can also open Digital Twins from **Settings** > **Companies** to create operators in company context. Digital twins can also be activated through [Plugin Packs](plugin-packs.md) — 7 of the 10 bundled packs link directly to a persona template.

Heartbeat v3 is the default runtime for all heartbeat-enabled twins. See [Heartbeat v3](heartbeat-v3.md) for the architecture source of truth.

## Concepts

### Persona Template

A JSON blueprint defining a digital twin. Each template specifies:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Role config** | Capabilities, autonomy level, personality, system prompt |
| **Heartbeat config** | `pulseEveryMinutes`, `dispatchCooldownMinutes`, `maxDispatchesPerDay`, `heartbeatProfile`, active hours, and stagger support |
| **Cognitive offload** | Which categories of mental work the twin absorbs |
| **Proactive tasks** | Tasks with cadence, execution mode, signal threshold, and priority |
| **Skills** | Recommended skill references with reasons |
| **Metadata** | Category, tags, seniority range, industry-agnostic flag |

### Heartbeat v3 Model

Twins use a two-lane heartbeat model:

- **Pulse** is cheap, deterministic, and non-LLM. It reduces signals, due proactive work, due checklist items, foreground state, and recent dispatch state into one decision.
- **Dispatch** is the escalation lane. It only runs when Pulse decides the situation justifies visible work.

Pulse can return `idle`, `deferred`, `suggestion`, `dispatch_task`, `dispatch_runbook`, or `handoff_to_cron`.

This matters because a twin no longer treats every wake as task work. Quiet `idle` and `deferred` pulses are normal.

### Heartbeat Profiles

Heartbeat behavior is profile-driven:

| Profile | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `observer` | Awareness only. Cheap silent checks, no checklist execution. |
| `operator` | Awareness plus checklist and proactive review. |
| `dispatcher` | Full escalation profile. Can create heartbeat tasks, runbooks, and cron handoffs. |

### Cognitive Offload Categories

Each template targets specific categories of work that fragment attention:

| Category | What It Absorbs |
|----------|----------------|
| `context-switching` | Gathering context when moving between projects or discussions |
| `status-reporting` | Compiling progress updates, standup summaries, executive briefs |
| `information-triage` | Filtering, prioritizing, and routing incoming information |
| `decision-preparation` | Assembling data, options, and trade-offs for pending decisions |
| `documentation` | Keeping docs current, writing change summaries, audit trails |
| `review-preparation` | Building review queues, risk assessments, review checklists |
| `dependency-tracking` | Monitoring external dependencies, vulnerabilities, blockers |
| `compliance-checks` | Checking against standards, SLAs, regulatory requirements |
| `knowledge-curation` | Organizing, tagging, and surfacing institutional knowledge |
| `routine-automation` | Handling repetitive checks and routine operational tasks |

### Proactive Tasks

Tasks that Heartbeat v3 evaluates during Pulse. Each proactive task has:

- **Prompt template**: Used when Dispatch or a follow-up execution path needs task context
- **Frequency**: How often it becomes due (in minutes)
- **Execution mode**: `pulse_only`, `dispatch`, or `cron_handoff`
- **Minimum signal strength**: Optional threshold before the task is considered relevant
- **Priority**: Execution order when multiple tasks are due
- **Enabled flag**: Toggled during activation or at runtime via the agent's soul config

Execution contract:

- Proactive tasks are cadence-checked in Pulse, not blindly turned into work on every wake
- `pulse_only` tasks stay cheap and local to heartbeat review
- `dispatch` tasks require a Dispatch escalation before visible work is created
- `cron_handoff` tasks are moved toward exact-time or heavyweight runbook scheduling
- Tasks can be ignored when signal strength is below `minSignalStrength`

## Setup

### Activating a Template

1. Open **Settings** > **Digital Twins** or open **Mission Control** and click **Add Digital Twin**
3. Browse templates — filter by category or search by name/tags
4. Click a template card to open the activation dialog
5. Customize:
   - **Twin Name** — e.g., "Sarah's SW Twin" or "Backend Team Twin"
   - **Pulse cadence** — how often the twin performs its cheap review cycle
   - **Heartbeat profile** — `observer`, `operator`, or `dispatcher`
   - **Dispatch controls** — cooldown, daily budget, and active hours when exposed
   - **Proactive Tasks** — toggle individual tasks on/off
6. Click **Create Digital Twin**

The twin appears as a new agent in Mission Control, ready to work.

### Company-Aware Activation

When Digital Twins is opened from **Settings** > **Companies**, or when a company context is already selected:

- the panel shows a company context strip
- the template gallery defaults to venture/operator recommendations
- recommended templates such as `Company Planner` and `Founder Office Operator` are promoted first
- created twins get a persisted company assignment
- the resulting twin name can be prefixed with the company name for clarity

This turns Digital Twins into the company-operator activation surface instead of a generic template browser.

### Activating Venture Operators

For founder-directed autonomous company setups, the recommended starter set is:

- `Company Planner`
- `Founder Office Operator`

Expanded operating team:

- `Growth Operator`
- `Customer Ops Lead`

These templates are intended to pair with the `Venture operator kit` workspace preset and the Mission Control strategic planner.

### What Activation Creates

- A new **AgentRole** record with the template's capabilities, personality, and system prompt
- Optional persisted **company assignment** when activation happens in company context
- **Heartbeat v3** configured with Pulse cadence and profile defaults
- **Cognitive offload config** embedded in the agent's soul JSON, including enabled proactive tasks
- Warnings if any recommended skills are not installed (non-blocking — the twin works without them)

---

## Daily Operation

Once activated, a twin operates in two modes.

### Proactive Mode (Heartbeat v3)

The twin runs Heartbeat v3 on its configured Pulse cadence. Pulse reviews merged signals, pending mentions/tasks, due proactive work, due checklist items, foreground contention, and dispatch guardrails before deciding whether anything should escalate.

For venture/operator twins, `.cowork/HEARTBEAT.md` acts as a recurring checklist input when the twin's `heartbeatProfile` allows maintenance execution. This is no longer controlled by `autonomyLevel`.

Results may appear as:

- no visible action (`idle` or `deferred`)
- an internal suggestion
- a heartbeat task
- a runbook request
- a cron handoff for exact-time or heavyweight work

When a twin is linked to a company, the product can also surface it as part of that company's operator set in:

- `Settings > Companies`
- `Settings > Digital Twins`
- `Mission Control`

**Software Engineer Twin (30-minute Pulse cadence):**

| Task | Frequency | What It Does |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| PR Review Queue | Every 60 min | Scans open PRs, builds prioritized review queue with risk ratings, flags stale PRs |
| Test Coverage Scan | Every 4 hours | Checks recent code changes for files lacking test coverage |
| Dependency Health | Every 8 hours | Runs dependency check for vulnerabilities and outdated packages |

**Engineering Manager Twin (30-minute Pulse cadence):**

| Task | Frequency | What It Does |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Team Status Digest | Every 2 hours | Aggregates team member activity into a status summary |
| Sprint Health Check | Every 4 hours | Monitors sprint progress, flags at-risk items, surfaces blockers |
| Cross-Team Dependency Scan | Every 8 hours | Tracks dependencies between teams, flags blockers early |

**VP of Engineering Twin (60-minute Pulse cadence):**

| Task | Frequency | What It Does |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Executive Brief | Every 8 hours | Compiles org-level metrics: velocity, quality, incidents |
| Strategic Risk Scan | Every 12 hours | Surfaces risks across teams: attrition signals, deadline slippage, tech debt accumulation |

### Reactive Mode (On-Demand)

Assign tasks directly to a twin via Mission Control or @mentions:

- Drag a task onto the twin's column in the Kanban board
- @mention the twin: `@sw-engineer-twin summarize what changed in the auth module this week`
- Use a bundled skill: `@twin prepare meeting brief for tomorrow's architecture review`

### Bundled Skills

Four skills ship with the Digital Twin system:

| Skill | ID | Purpose |
|-------|----|---------|
| **Status Report** | `twin-status-report` | Generate status reports from recent activity, git history, and task data |
| **PR Triage** | `twin-pr-triage` | Scan open PRs, assess risk, build a prioritized review queue |
| **Meeting Prep** | `twin-meeting-prep` | Prepare meeting briefs with context, open items, and talking points |
| **Decision Prep** | `twin-decision-prep` | Assemble data, options, and trade-offs for pending decisions |

---

## Enterprise Scenarios

### Individual Contributor (Software Engineer)

**Morning routine:**
- Twin already has a PR review queue ready from the overnight scan, prioritized by risk and staleness
- Before standup: twin runs `twin-status-report` — produces a summary from git history and completed tasks

**During the day:**
- Before a meeting: twin runs `twin-meeting-prep` — assembles relevant context, open items, and talking points
- When a dependency has a CVE: twin flags it in the next dependency health check

**Result:** Engineer stays in code. Twin handles the information-gathering that would otherwise fragment focus.

### Engineering Manager

**Morning routine:**
- Twin has a team status digest ready — who's working on what, who's blocked, what shipped yesterday
- Before 1-on-1s: twin prepared per-person notes (recent work, accomplishments, open items)

**Weekly:**
- Sprint health check surfaces at-risk items before they become problems
- Cross-team dependency scan flags blockers early

**Result:** Manager focuses on people and unblocking. Twin handles data aggregation and status compilation.

### Product Manager

**Morning routine:**
- Twin triaged overnight feature requests and bug reports by priority and theme
- Competitive landscape changes surfaced from monitored sources

**Before sprint planning:**
- Twin prepared a decision package for the top 3 prioritization trade-offs
- Customer feedback synthesized by feature area

**Result:** PM focuses on stakeholder alignment and strategy. Twin handles the information triage.

### Technical Director / VP

**Weekly:**
- Executive brief with org-level metrics (velocity trends, quality metrics, incident rates)
- Architecture decision records prepared with options, trade-offs, and recommendations

**Quarterly:**
- OKR progress tracking across all teams
- Technology radar updates (what's working, what's struggling, what to watch)

**Result:** Leadership focuses on strategy and decisions. Twin handles the reporting and analysis.

### Scaling Across an Organization

For a team of 50 engineers, 5 managers, 2 directors, and 1 VP:

1. Activate 50 **Software Engineer** twins — each named for the person (e.g., "Sarah's Twin")
2. Activate 5 **Engineering Manager** twins
3. Activate 2 **Technical Director** twins
4. Activate 1 **VP of Engineering** twin

Each twin learns over time through the existing playbook and relationship memory systems. Corrections, preferences, and successful approaches get captured and reinforced. The knowledge graph builds organizational context (who owns what, cross-team dependencies) that all twins can reference.

## Channel Integration

Since CoWork OS supports 17 messaging channels, twins can be reached from anywhere:

| Channel | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Slack** | `/inbox @twin-engineering-manager prepare 1-on-1 notes for tomorrow` |
| **Teams** | `@twin-sw-engineer summarize auth module changes this week` |
| **Email** | Forward a thread to the twin for context extraction and summarization |
| **Discord** | `!ask @twin-devops check deployment pipeline status` |

Heartbeat results can be delivered to channels — e.g., post the daily PR triage to `#engineering-reviews`.

---

## Customization

### At Activation Time

- **Name**: Any display name for the twin
- **Pulse cadence**: 5 minutes to 4 hours
- **Heartbeat profile**: `observer`, `operator`, or `dispatcher`
- **Proactive tasks**: Enable/disable individual tasks
- All other role properties (capabilities, autonomy, personality) come from the template defaults

### After Activation

The twin is a standard AgentRole — all properties can be edited via the Agent Role Editor in Mission Control:

- Change capabilities, autonomy level, or personality
- Adjust Pulse cadence, Dispatch controls, or active hours
- Edit the system prompt or soul configuration
- Modify proactive task settings in the soul JSON

### Adding Custom Templates

Templates are JSON files in `resources/persona-templates/`. To add a custom template:

1. Create a JSON file following the `PersonaTemplate` schema
2. Place it in the persona templates directory
3. Restart CoWork OS — the template appears in the gallery

## Technical Details

### Architecture

```
PersonaTemplate (JSON)
    ↓ activate()
AgentRole (SQLite)
    ↓ pulse cadence
Heartbeat v3
  ├─ Signal ledger + checklist cache + proactive cadence evaluation
  ├─ Pulse (non-LLM, no task creation)
  └─ Dispatch (suggestion/task/runbook/cron handoff when justified)
    ↓
Mission Control + Task system + Run records
```

### Where Data Lives

| Data | Location |
|------|----------|
| Template definitions | `resources/persona-templates/*.json` |
| Bundled skills | `resources/skills/twin-*.json` |
| Activated twin config | `agent_roles` table (SQLite) |
| Proactive task config | `soul` JSON field on the AgentRole |
| Task results | Standard task records in SQLite |

### IPC Channels

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `personaTemplate:list` | List all templates with optional filter |
| `personaTemplate:get` | Get a single template by ID |
| `personaTemplate:activate` | Create an AgentRole from a template |
| `personaTemplate:preview` | Preview what activation will create |
| `personaTemplate:getCategories` | Get category list with counts |

### Service

`PersonaTemplateService` follows the same pattern as `CustomSkillLoader`:
- Loads JSON from `resources/persona-templates/` (dev: `process.cwd()`, prod: `process.resourcesPath`)
- No new database tables — templates instantiate into existing AgentRole records
- Skills are referenced by ID, not embedded — missing skills produce warnings, not errors

---

## Plugin Pack Integration

Digital twins are deeply integrated with the [Plugin Pack](plugin-packs.md) system. Seven of the ten bundled packs link directly to a persona template, and packs can be installed, managed, and distributed through the Plugin Store.

### Plugin Store

The in-app **Plugin Store** (accessible via the "+" button in the Customize panel) provides:
- **Browse & install** packs from the remote registry that include linked digital twins
- **Install from Git** — clone a community pack that bundles a twin configuration
- **Create new packs** — scaffold a custom pack that links to any existing persona template

### Admin Policies

Organization admins can control twin-related packs via [Admin Policies](admin-policies.md):
- **Require** specific packs (e.g., ensure all engineers have the Engineering pack with its Software Engineer twin)
- **Block** packs that aren't approved for the organization
- **Limit agent resources** — cap heartbeat frequency and concurrent agents

See [Plugin Packs](plugin-packs.md) and [Admin Policies](admin-policies.md) for details.
