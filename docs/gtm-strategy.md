# CoWork OS — Product Positioning & GTM Strategy

> Status: Active draft, aligned to current product docs.

## Category Definition

CoWork OS is a **security-hardened, local-first AI operating system**.

- OpenClaw is best positioned as an agent experimentation toolkit.
- CoWork OS is positioned as the production runtime for running agents safely across real workflows.

## Primary Positioning Statement

CoWork OS is the production alternative to OpenClaw for users who need:

- Guardrails and approval workflows by default
- Local-first data ownership (BYOK, no telemetry)
- A multi-channel operating layer (15 messaging channels)
- A desktop + headless runtime that can be governed in daily operations

Short form:

> OpenClaw is excellent for experimentation. CoWork OS is optimized for governed daily operations.

## Core Buyer Profiles

1. Technical founders running customer-facing or ops-heavy automation.
2. Security-conscious builders who need local control over data and keys.
3. Team leads who want agent output in existing messaging channels with approval gates.
4. Power users who want agent autonomy without cloud lock-in.

## Differentiation Pillars

### 1) Playground to Production

CoWork OS prioritizes execution discipline over experimentation novelty:
approval workflows, guardrail budgets, policy enforcement, and sandboxed execution.

### 2) Security-First by Design

CoWork OS ships with core controls required for practical use:
dangerous command blocking, configurable limits, encrypted local settings, and context-aware tool controls.

### 3) Multi-Channel AI Operating Layer

CoWork OS is not just a local runner. It is a messaging-native runtime across 15 channels with shared security modes and governance.

### 4) Local-First + BYOK

Users keep control of data and provider keys with optional offline model execution via Ollama.

## Proof Points to Reuse in Messaging

- 30+ LLM providers
- 15 messaging channels
- 100+ built-in skills
- 4000+ tests
- ZeroLeaks report published in-repo

## Narrative Guardrails

Do:

- Contrast category focus (toolkit vs operating system).
- Emphasize production readiness and security controls.
- Stay factual and neutral in competitor references.
- Explicitly respect OpenClaw and its community.

Do not:

- Frame as "more features than OpenClaw" only.
- Rely on speculative competitor claims.
- Use adversarial language.

## SEO Guidance

Use these phrases naturally in docs and landing sections:

- OpenClaw alternative
- alternative to OpenClaw
- OpenClaw vs CoWork OS

Keep SEO copy factual and fit-based. Avoid negative or inflammatory wording.

## Best Initial Wedges

> This section describes GTM entry points within the existing category — not a repositioning. CoWork OS remains a security-hardened, local-first AI operating system.

The three operational lanes where CoWork OS has the clearest initial ROI are governed, intelligence-heavy workflows that benefit most from approval gates, local data control, and measurable outcome delivery:

| Lane | Pack | Primary Connectors | Why It Wins Early |
|------|------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Support Ops** | Customer Support Pack | Zendesk, ServiceNow | High-volume, well-defined quality criteria; completion rate and response time are measurable on day one |
| **IT Ops** | DevOps Pack | ServiceNow, Jira, Linear | Incident and release workflows have clear triggers, audit requirements, and high cost of error |
| **Sales Ops** | Sales CRM Pack | HubSpot, Salesforce | Outbound workflows are repetitive but require personalization — the balance where governed AI delivery performs best |

These are best-fit entry points, not exclusions. CoWork OS works across many workflows; these three have the most predictable buyer, measurable outcome, and vendor-swap-friendly structure.
