# Security Policy

> **For end users**: See [SECURITY_GUIDE.md](SECURITY_GUIDE.md) for a comprehensive guide on the app's security model, permissions, and best practices.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at CoWork OS. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab of the repository
2. **Email**: Send details to info@coworkosapp.com

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., code injection, path traversal, etc.)
- Full paths of affected source files
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact assessment of the vulnerability

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Assessment**: We'll investigate and determine the severity
3. **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Considerations

### API Keys and Secrets

- **Never commit API keys** or secrets to the repository
- Store sensitive data in `.env` files (which are gitignored)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- The app stores API keys locally in the user's system

### File System Access

- All file operations are sandboxed to the selected workspace
- Path traversal attacks are prevented
- Destructive operations (delete, bulk rename) require user approval

### Network Security

- Network access requires explicit permission
- Future versions will include domain allowlisting
- All API calls use HTTPS

### Local Data Storage

- SQLite database is stored in user's Application Support folder
- No sensitive data is transmitted to external services (except configured LLM providers)
- Users control their own API keys

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Protect API Keys**: Never share your `.env` file
3. **Review Permissions**: Be cautious when approving file operations
4. **Workspace Selection**: Only grant access to necessary folders
5. **Network Awareness**: Monitor any network permission requests

## Known Security Issues

### Build Dependency: tar (GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97, GHSA-r6q2-hw4h-h46w)

**Status**: Acknowledged, awaiting upstream fix

**Affected packages**: `tar` <=7.5.3 used by `electron-builder` and `@electron/rebuild`

**Impact**: Development/build environment only. These vulnerabilities relate to tarball extraction during the build process. The packaged application does not include or use the vulnerable `tar` package.

**Risk assessment**:
- **Runtime risk**: None - tar is a devDependency only
- **Attack vector**: Malicious tarball during `npm install`
- **Realistic threat**: Low - developers control what packages are installed

**Why it's not fixed**:
- The patched `tar` v7.5.6+ uses ESM exports incompatible with current `electron-builder`
- Waiting for `electron-builder` maintainers to update their dependencies
- Using `npm audit fix --force` breaks the build toolchain

**Mitigation**:
- Only install dependencies from trusted sources
- Review package changes before updating
- Monitor electron-builder releases for updates
