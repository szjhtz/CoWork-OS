## How It Works

### Execution Flow

```
1. User selects workspace folder
   |
2. User creates task with description
   |
3. AgentDaemon starts TaskExecutor
   |
4. TaskExecutor calls LLM (any configured provider) to create plan
   |
5. For each plan step:
   - LLM decides which tools to use
   - TaskExecutor calls tools via ToolRegistry
   - Tools perform operations (with permission checks)
   - Results sent back to LLM
   - Events logged and streamed to UI
   |
6. If approval needed:
   - TaskExecutor pauses
   - ApprovalDialog shown to user
   - User approves/denies
   - Execution continues or fails
   |
7. Task completes
   - Status updated to "completed"
   - All events logged in database
   - Artifacts tracked
```

### Permission Model

```
Workspace Permissions:
├── Read: Enabled by default
├── Write: Enabled by default
├── Delete: Enabled, requires approval
├── Network: Enabled (for web search)
└── Shell: Requires approval

Operations Requiring Approval:
├── Delete file
├── Delete multiple files
├── Bulk rename (>10 files)
├── Shell command execution
└── External service calls
```

## What's NOT Implemented (Planned)

### VM Sandbox
- **Status**: Stub implementation
- **File**: `src/electron/agent/sandbox/runner.ts`
- **What's needed**:
  - macOS Virtualization.framework integration
  - Linux VM image
  - Workspace mount
  - Network egress controls

### Sub-Agents / Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Status**: Implemented (Collaborative Mode, Multi-LLM Mode, Agent Comparison)
- **What's built**:
  - Collaborative Mode: ephemeral multi-agent teams with real-time thought sharing
  - Multi-LLM Mode: same task dispatched to multiple providers with judge synthesis
  - Agent Comparison Mode: side-by-side output comparison across agents/models
  - Capability Matcher: auto-select agents based on task requirements
  - Git Worktree Isolation: per-task isolated branches with auto-commit/merge/cleanup

## Ready to Use

### You Can:
1. Select workspaces and create tasks
2. Use any configured LLM provider, including local Ollama and 30+ supported provider/gateway options
3. Execute multi-step file operations
4. Create real Office documents (.xlsx, .docx, .pdf, .pptx)
5. Search the web with multiple providers
6. Automate browser interactions
7. Run tasks remotely via WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Slack
8. Track all agent activity in real-time
9. Approve/deny destructive operations
10. Receive automatic updates
11. Use Goal Mode with success criteria and auto-retry
12. Create custom skills with reusable workflows
13. Connect to MCP servers for extended tool access
14. Run multiple tasks in parallel (1-10 concurrent)
15. Configure safety guardrails (budgets, blocked commands)
16. Use system tools (screenshots, clipboard, open apps)
17. View artifacts with the in-app file viewer
18. Customize agent personality via Settings or conversation prompts
19. Run tasks in isolated git worktrees with auto-commit and merge
20. Use collaborative mode for multi-agent team reasoning
21. Use multi-LLM mode to compare outputs across providers
22. Compare agent outputs side by side
23. Pin tasks for quick access
24. Gracefully wrap up running tasks
25. Use git tools (commit, diff, branch) within tasks

### You Cannot (Yet):
1. Execute arbitrary code in a VM sandbox
2. Apply network egress controls

- [ ] `npm install` completed successfully
- [ ] On macOS or Windows (required for Electron desktop features)

Then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected behavior:
1. Vite dev server starts (port 5173)
2. Electron window opens
3. DevTools open automatically
4. Workspace selector appears
5. Configure API credentials in Settings (gear icon)

## Performance Characteristics

### Token Usage (varies by provider)
- **Plan creation**: ~500-1000 tokens
- **Step execution**: ~1000-3000 tokens per step
- **Average task**: 5000-10000 tokens total

### Timing
- **Plan creation**: 2-5 seconds
- **Simple file operation**: 3-6 seconds per step
- **Document creation**: 5-10 seconds
- **Browser automation**: 2-10 seconds per action
- **Web search**: 1-3 seconds

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~200-400MB (Electron + Playwright when active)
- **Database**: <1MB per task
- **CPU**: Minimal (except during API calls)

## Summary

**CoWork OS is a production-ready, security-first personal AI assistant platform:**

### Core Strengths
- **Security**: 3200+ tests, configurable guardrails, approval workflows, brute-force protection
- **Multi-Channel**: WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage integration
- **Multi-Provider**: 30+ LLM providers and compatible gateways, including Claude, GPT, Gemini, Bedrock, OpenRouter, and Ollama
- **Local-First**: Your data stays on your machine, BYOK model
- **Extensible**: MCP support (Client, Host, Registry), 139 built-in skills, and plugin packs

### Feature Highlights
- Real Office document creation (Excel, Word, PDF, PowerPoint)
- Web search and browser automation
- Code tools (glob, grep, edit_file) and git tools (commit, diff, branch)
- Collaborative Mode with real-time thought sharing
- Multi-LLM Mode with judge-based synthesis
- Agent Comparison Mode for side-by-side output comparison
- Git Worktree Isolation for per-task branch isolation
- Task pinning and graceful wrap-up
- Personality customization (6 styles, 9 personas)
- Goal Mode with auto-retry
- Parallel task queue (1-10 concurrent)
- Remote access (Tailscale, SSH, WebSocket API)

### Planned
- VM sandbox using macOS Virtualization.framework
- Network egress controls with proxy
- Linux desktop support
- Web Browser Mode (`--serve`) — full app accessible from any browser via HTTP/WebSocket

The architecture is extensible. All future features can be added without refactoring core systems.

Ready to run with: `npm install && npm run dev`
