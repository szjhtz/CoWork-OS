## Agent Capabilities

- **Ideas Panel**: Curated launch panel accessible from the sidebar above Sessions. Pre-written prompts organized by category let you start common workflows in one click. See [Ideas Panel: Supported Capabilities](ideas-capabilities.md) for the full list of tools each prompt uses and their graceful fallbacks.
- **Task-Based Workflow**: Multi-step execution with plan-execute-observe loops
- **Live Terminal**: Shell commands run in a real-time terminal view — see output as it happens, stop execution, or provide interactive input (e.g. `y`/`n` prompts)
- **Dynamic Re-Planning**: Agent can revise its plan mid-execution
- **139+ Built-in Skills**: GitHub, Slack, Notion, Spotify, Apple Notes, Unity, Unreal, Terraform, Kubernetes, financial analysis, and more. Optional CLI-based skills (e.g. [aurl](skills/aurl.md) for OpenAPI/GraphQL APIs) appear when the binary is installed.
- **Chat Mode**: Direct LLM chat with no tools, no step timeline, same-session follow-ups, chat-only streaming for supported providers, and a fixed high output budget for explicit `executionMode: "chat"` sessions. See [Chat Mode](chat-mode.md).
- **Document Creation**: Excel, Word, PDF, PowerPoint with professional formatting
- **Document Editing Sessions**: Inline PDF region editing and DOCX block replacement. Open a document from the Files panel or task artifact surface to enter an editing session with version browsing and document-aware controls.
- **Persistent Memory**: Cross-session context with privacy-aware observation capture
- **Knowledge Graph**: SQLite-backed entity/relationship memory with FTS5 search, graph traversal, and auto-extraction
- **Workspace Kit**: `.cowork/` project kit + markdown indexing with context injection
- **Agent Teams**: Multi-agent collaboration with shared checklists, coordinated runs, and team management UI
- **Collaborative Mode**: Auto-create ephemeral teams where multiple agents work on the same task, sharing thoughts in real-time
- **Multi-LLM Mode**: Send the same task to multiple LLM providers/models simultaneously, with a judge agent synthesizing the best result
- **Agent Comparison Mode**: Compare agent or model outputs side by side
- **Sub-Task Navigation**: Open a delegated sub-task, inspect its timeline, then jump back to the parent task from the main content view
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Tasks run in isolated git worktrees with automatic branch creation, auto-commit, merge, conflict detection, and cleanup
- **Task Pinning**: Pin important tasks in the sidebar for quick access
- **Wrap-Up Task**: Gracefully wrap up running tasks instead of hard-cancelling
- **Capability Matcher**: Auto-select the best agents for a task
- **Completion Output Confidence UX**: When tasks finish with file outputs, users get high-signal completion toasts with direct actions (`Open file`, `Show in Finder`, `View in Files`), automatic right-panel focus for the active task, and unseen-output badges when reviewing another task/view.
- **Artifact-First Output Visibility**: Artifact-only tasks are treated the same as file-created outputs across progress, timeline, and Files panel surfaces.
- **Performance Reviews**: Score and review agent-role outcomes with autonomy-level recommendations
- **Vision**: Analyze workspace images via `analyze_image` tool (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or Bedrock)
- **Image Attachments**: Attach images to tasks and follow-ups for multimodal analysis
- **Image Generation**: Multi-provider support (Gemini, OpenAI gpt-image-1/1.5/DALL-E, Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter) with configurable provider ordering
- **Video Generation**: Text-to-video and image-to-video via new video generation providers. Configure preferred video model in Settings > LLM. Generated videos render inline in the task feed.
- **Visual Annotation**: Iterative image refinement with the Visual Annotator
- **Context Summarization**: Automatic context compression surfaced in the task timeline
- **Structured Input Requests**: In plan-mode flows, the agent can pause with 1-3 short multiple-choice questions instead of asking ambiguous free-text follow-ups
- **Parallel Tool Timeline**: Concurrent read-only tool bursts are grouped into lane-based timeline cards instead of flooding the event feed
- **Renderer Performance**: In the `CoWork-OS/CoWork-OS` repo, the renderer uses `@chenglou/pretext` for text-heavy sidebar/timeline measurement, with flattened visible sidebar rows and post-render height reconciliation for expanded timeline cards
- **Adaptive Runtime Recovery**: Execute tasks use adaptive turn budgets, bounded follow-up recovery, and safety-stop escalation instead of hard window failure by default
- **Path Drift Repair**: `/workspace/...` aliases and drifted relative paths can be normalized back into the active workspace or pinned task root, with strict-fail policies when hard enforcement is preferred
- **Action-First Planning**: Agent prioritizes direct action over excessive pre-planning
- **Voice Calls**: Outbound phone calls via ElevenLabs Agents
- **Think With Me Mode**: Socratic brainstorming mode that helps clarify thinking without executing tools. Activated via toggle or auto-detected from brainstorm/trade-off patterns.
- **Problem Framing Pre-flight**: Complex tasks show a structured problem restatement, assumptions, risks, and approach before execution begins
- **Graceful Uncertainty**: Agent expresses uncertainty honestly and rates confidence on recommendations. Low-confidence messages display with an amber indicator.
- **AI Playbook**: Auto-captures successful patterns (approach, outcome, tools) and lessons from failures with error classification (7 categories: tool failure, wrong approach, missing context, permission denied, timeout, rate limit, user correction). Time-based decay scoring deprioritises stale entries. Proven patterns reinforced on repeated success. Mid-task user corrections automatically detected and captured. Relevant entries injected into system prompts. View in Settings > AI Playbook.
- **Message-Level Feedback**: Every completed assistant message shows 👍 / 👎 buttons. Thumbs-down opens a structured reason picker (Incorrect, Too verbose, Ignored instructions, Wrong tone, Unsafe / unwanted). Feedback is routed to the User Profile and Adaptive Style Engine for continuous style learning.
- **Evolving Agent Intelligence**: The agent visibly improves over time through a connected set of subsystems — unified memory synthesis, adaptive style learning, playbook-to-skill promotion, channel persona adaptation, evolution metrics, and daily operational journaling. See [Evolving Agent Intelligence](evolving-agent-intelligence.md).

### Inbox Agent

Local-first inbox workspace for email triage, follow-up, task capture, cross-channel identity, and operator handoff.

- **Live inbox surfaces**: `Unread`, `Action Needed`, `Suggested Actions`, and `Open Commitments`
- **Mailbox views**: `Inbox`, `Sent`, and `All`, with `Recent` and `Priority` sorting
- **Action rail**: cleanup, follow-up, thread prep, todo extraction, scheduling, and intel refresh
- **Thread visibility**: received and sent message content are both shown in the thread detail view
- **Cross-channel replies**: reply directly via linked Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, Signal, or iMessage targets when email is not the best channel
- **Unified identity**: manual search/link in Settings can attach Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, and CRM handles to one contact identity
- **Relationship timeline**: the research rail merges email and channel history into one relationship timeline with channel preference hints
- **Mission Control handoff**: threads can be turned into company issues, assigned to an operator, and woken from the inbox
- **Inbox automations**: rules, reminder cadences, and patrol schedules can create tasks, wake agents, and schedule review flows
- **Commitment handling**: accepted commitments become real follow-up tasks that can later be marked done or dismissed
- **Event pipeline**: mailbox sync, triage, draft, and action events feed Knowledge Graph, Heartbeat, triggers, playbooks, and briefing
- **Safer review**: sensitive-content warnings and draft review keep outbound actions visible before anything leaves the app
- **Local persistence**: cached mail remains visible after restart while background sync refreshes new mail

See the full workflow guide in [Inbox Agent](inbox-agent.md).

### Managed Devices & Remote Operations

CoWork OS now includes a dedicated Devices tab for running and observing work across multiple machines.

- **Local + remote device inventory**: track the current machine alongside saved remote devices in one view
- **Connection-aware remote cards**: direct, SSH-tunneled, and Tailscale-backed devices expose connection state, last-seen time, active runs, storage summary, app summary, and attention state
- **Remote task dispatch**: start a task on a selected remote device, optionally with shell access, execution mode, or multi-LLM options
- **Remote file picker**: browse remote workspaces and attach files directly from the target machine before dispatching a task
- **Remote task feed**: filter tasks for the selected device, all devices, or attention states, then open those tasks in a remote session view
- **Device overlays**: inspect apps, storage, resource signals, alerts, and observer history without leaving the Devices surface

See [Remote Access](remote-access.md) for connection patterns and [Mission Control](mission-control.md) for the company-level control surface.

### Automations Control Center

Automation features are now grouped together in `Settings > Automations`:

- **Task Queue**: concurrency, queueing, and background execution policy
- **Self-Improve**: bounded autonomous improvement campaigns for git-backed workspaces
- **Scheduled Tasks**: recurring time-based task execution
- **Webhooks**: inbound automation entry points
- **Event Triggers**: condition-based actions triggered by channel, webhook, or runtime events
- **Daily Briefing**: scheduled summaries with workspace, memory, and evolution context

The home dashboard also surfaces recent automation runs so background work is visible without opening Settings.

### Zero-Human Company Ops

CoWork OS can also be configured as a founder-directed autonomous company shell by composing several existing systems into one operating loop:

- **Venture operator workspace kit**: initializes `.cowork/` with `COMPANY.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, `KPIS.md`, `PRIORITIES.md`, and `HEARTBEAT.md`
- **Companies control surface**: `Settings > Companies` centralizes company creation, company-graph editing, linked operators, and direct handoff into Digital Twins or Mission Control
- **Operator twins**: venture-oriented personas such as `Founder Office Operator`, `Company Planner`, `Growth Operator`, and `Customer Ops Lead`
- **Heartbeat v3 follow-up**: operator and dispatcher twins can proactively review recurring checks defined in `HEARTBEAT.md`, while cheap Pulse cycles stay non-LLM until escalation is justified
- **Strategic planner**: turns company goals, projects, and stalled work into planner-managed issues and optionally auto-dispatches them into tasks
- **Mission Control ops view**: exposes planner config, planner runs, goals, projects, issues, linked tasks, issue comments, and run events
- **Autonomy policy integration**: operator roles can carry reusable autonomy presets instead of relying on one global all-or-nothing mode
- **Persisted company-linked operators**: venture/operator twins can be assigned to a company so the same operator set stays visible across Companies, Digital Twins, and Mission Control
- **Companies tab as the source of truth**: `Settings > Companies` centralizes company metadata, goals, projects, issues, linked operators, planner state, and handoff into company-scoped Mission Control views

This workflow is designed for "human-directed, agent-operated" execution:

- humans define business goals, guardrails, and irreversible approval policy
- agents continuously create, route, and execute operational work
- Mission Control becomes the monitoring and intervention cockpit

See [Zero-Human Company Operations](zero-human-company.md) for architecture, setup recipe, monitoring flow, and example operating models.

### Self-Improve

The self-improvement loop is now intentionally narrower and more operational:

- **Owner-only eligibility**: currently restricted to unpackaged runs of the canonical CoWork OS repository with maintainer-signed owner enrollment
- **Single-lane bounded campaigns by default**: new settings default to one variant, one concurrent executor, and one queued campaign
- **Explicit campaign stages**: `queued`, `preflight`, `reproducing`, `implementing`, `verifying`, and `completed`
- **Promotion gate hardening**: campaigns are promoted only when the winning run shows reproduction, verification, and PR-readiness evidence
- **Cooldowns and parking**: repeated provider failures or deterministic failures are cooled down and eventually parked instead of retried forever
- **Provider health visibility**: the settings panel surfaces recent provider-related incidents and blocked/degraded states

See [Self-Improving Agent](self-improving-agent.md) for the architecture and operational guidance.

### Reliability Flywheel

Reliability is built as a continuous loop: capture failures -> replay deterministically -> gate risky completions -> harden nightly/release workflows.

| Reliability Capability | What It Does |
|------------------------|--------------|
| **Eval Corpus (local)** | Converts failed/partial tasks into replayable eval cases stored in local SQLite |
| **Deterministic Replay** | Re-runs eval suites to catch regressions before they reappear in production usage |
| **Risk-Based Review Gate** | Scores task risk (`low`/`medium`/`high`) and escalates review/verification only when justified |
| **Policy Modes** | `off`, `balanced`, and `strict` review policies for domain-appropriate guard strength |
| **Skill/Prompt Hardening** | Uses modular prompt sections, explicit token budgets, and skill shortlist routing to reduce drift and context overload |
| **PR Reliability Contract** | Enforces “production failure fix must add/update eval case” in CI |
| **Nightly Hardening** | Runs eval + battery loops nightly, produces grouped and machine-readable artifacts |
| **Release Gate** | Applies hardening checks before release with a date-based stability-window promotion |
| **Local-Only Data Policy** | Keeps reliability artifacts local; no required telemetry upload path |

See [Reliability Flywheel](reliability-flywheel.md) for architecture, schema, scripts, IPC endpoints, CI workflows, and operational commands.

### Mode Picker

The UI exposes a small set of execution modes. Chat mode is separate from task execution and uses the direct conversation path.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Chat** | Direct assistant conversation, no tools, no step timeline, same-session follow-ups, and chat-only streaming for supported providers. |
| **Execute** | Full task execution path with tools, planning, and artifacts. |
| **Plan** | Structured planning path; can pause for `request_user_input` and is intended for non-mutating planning/coordination. |
| **Analyze** | Read-only analysis path that stays evidence-focused and blocks mutating tools. |
| **Verified** | Execute-like path that adds external verification checks after steps before completion. |

These modes are mutually exclusive. Chat is the conversational path; the others are task execution modes.

> **Note:** Verified mode is strongest when you want execution plus an explicit verification gate. Plan mode shows a confirmation dialog only for structured input requests, not because it bypasses approvals.

### Task Toggles

The task creation UI also includes higher-level toggles that change how tasks are orchestrated:

| Toggle | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Autonomous** | Auto-approves all gated actions (shell commands, file deletions, etc.) so the agent runs without pauses. Disables user input prompts. |
| **Collaborative** | Auto-creates an ephemeral team of agents that analyze the task from multiple perspectives, then a leader synthesizes the results. Phases: dispatch → think → synthesize → complete. |
| **Multi-LLM** | Sends the same task to multiple LLM providers/models in parallel. A designated judge model synthesizes the best result. Requires 2+ providers configured. |
| **Think With Me** | Socratic brainstorming mode — agent asks follow-up questions and explores trade-offs without executing tools. Read-only tools only. |

> **Note:** Autonomous mode shows a confirmation dialog before enabling, since it bypasses all approval prompts.

### Chat Mode

Chat mode is the direct assistant conversation surface. It is designed for normal Q&A, not task execution.

- **No tools**: the assistant does not plan or call tools in chat mode
- **No step timeline**: chat turns do not render execution steps
- **Same-session follow-ups**: later questions stay in the current conversation thread
- **Explicit only**: chat behavior is enabled only when `executionMode` is explicitly set to `chat`
- **High output budget**: explicit chat sessions use a fixed 48K target output cap, clamped to the active provider budget
- **History strategy**: long chat sessions use a summary-plus-recent-window prompt strategy with cached summary reuse

See [Chat Mode](chat-mode.md) for the full behavior contract.

When the agent is operating in plan-mode execution, it can also use `request_user_input` to pause for structured multiple-choice decisions. Responses are persisted locally and can be submitted from either the desktop UI or the Control Plane web dashboard.

### Guided Decisions & Runtime Recovery

The runtime now includes a set of decision and recovery contracts aimed at keeping tasks convergent without hiding failures:

| Capability | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| **Structured input requests** | `request_user_input` asks 1-3 concise multiple-choice questions, pauses the task, and resumes after submit/dismiss. Only available in plan mode. |
| **Adaptive turn-window recovery** | Execute-oriented tasks default to `adaptive_unbounded`, soft-log exhausted windows, reserve space for finalization, and allow a bounded follow-up recovery attempt before triggering a safety stop. |
| **Context overflow retry** | Context-capacity errors trigger compaction plus retry instead of immediate hard failure when the model context window is exceeded. |
| **Workspace alias repair** | Absolute alias paths such as `/workspace/...` can be remapped into the active workspace for file and directory tools, or blocked via `strict_fail`. |
| **Pinned task-root repair** | Relative paths that drift outside the task's canonical root can be rewritten back under the pinned root, retried with a bounded budget, or rejected under strict policy. |
| **Parallel tool-lane rendering** | Parallel read-only tool groups are projected into stable lane rows in the timeline so summary mode stays readable. |

## Digital Twin Personas

Pre-built AI agent templates that create role-specific digital twins for team members. Each twin absorbs cognitively draining work so the human can stay in deep focus.

- **Built-in templates across engineering, management, product, data, operations, and venture/operator roles**: including Software Engineer, Engineering Manager, Product Manager, Company Planner, Founder Office Operator, Growth Operator, and Customer Ops Lead
- **Heartbeat v3 default**: twins use cheap deterministic Pulse checks by default and escalate via Dispatch only when signals, cadence, or manual intervention justify visible work
- **Profile-based execution**: `observer`, `operator`, and `dispatcher` profiles control maintenance eligibility and escalation authority
- **Proactive task modes**: `pulse_only`, `dispatch`, and `cron_handoff`
- **10 cognitive offload categories**: context-switching, status-reporting, information-triage, decision-preparation, documentation, review-preparation, dependency-tracking, compliance-checks, knowledge-curation, routine-automation
- **4 bundled skills**: `twin-status-report`, `twin-pr-triage`, `twin-meeting-prep`, `twin-decision-prep`
- **One-click activation**: Browse gallery, customize name, Pulse cadence, heartbeat profile, and proactive tasks, then create
- **Enterprise scaling**: Activate one twin per team member across the organization

Access from **Mission Control** > **Add Digital Twin**. See [Digital Twins](digital-twins.md) and [Heartbeat v3](heartbeat-v3.md) for the current runtime model.

---

## ChatGPT History Import

Import your full ChatGPT conversation history into CoWork OS's memory system. Instead of starting from scratch, the agent immediately understands your preferences, past projects, communication style, and context from hundreds or thousands of previous conversations.

### How It Works

1. **Export from ChatGPT**: Go to [ChatGPT Settings > Data Controls > Export Data](https://chat.openai.com/#settings/DataControls). OpenAI emails you a `.zip` file containing `conversations.json`.
2. **Import in CoWork OS**: Go to **Settings > Memory > Import ChatGPT History** and select the exported `.zip` or `conversations.json` file.
3. **Processing**: Conversations are parsed, deduplicated, and stored as memory entries with full-text search indexing. User messages are captured as context; assistant responses are summarized for token efficiency.

### What Gets Imported

| Data | How It's Used |
|------|---------------|
| **Your messages** | Stored as observations — reveals your interests, projects, preferences, and communication style |
| **Assistant responses** | Summarized and stored as insights — captures decisions, recommendations, and solutions you received |
| **Conversation titles** | Indexed for semantic search — helps match relevant past context to new tasks |
| **Timestamps** | Preserved for time-based relevance ranking — recent conversations weighted higher |

### Security & Privacy

- **Stored locally only** — All imported data is written to the local SQLite database on your Mac. Nothing is uploaded, synced, or sent anywhere.
- **Encrypted at rest** — The database is protected by the same AES-256 encryption and OS keychain integration used for all CoWork OS data.
- **Privacy filtering** — The same auto-detection that filters API keys, passwords, and tokens from regular memories applies to imported history.
- **No provider access** — Imported memories are injected into prompts locally. Your ChatGPT history is never sent back to OpenAI or any other provider — only the relevant snippets are included in task context.
- **Deletable** — You can clear all imported memories at any time from Settings > Memory.

### Why This Matters

Most AI assistants start with zero context about you. Every new tool means re-explaining your preferences, projects, and constraints. ChatGPT history import eliminates this cold-start problem — CoWork OS learns from your existing AI conversations so it can be useful from the first task.

## Self-Improving Agent

Multi-layered learning system that improves agent behaviour across sessions. No external dependencies — all learning runs locally.

| Layer | Service | What It Learns |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Task Patterns** | PlaybookService | Successful approaches, failure categories, error recovery strategies |
| **Core Memory** | MemoryService | Observations, decisions, insights with hybrid semantic + BM25 search |
| **User Profile** | UserProfileService | Name, preferences, location, goals, constraints |
| **Relationship** | RelationshipMemoryService | 5-layer context: identity, preferences, context, history, commitments |
| **Feedback** | FeedbackService | Rejection patterns, preference corrections, workspace-local MISTAKES.md |

**Key mechanisms:**
- **Error classification**: 7 categories for targeted recovery strategies
- **Confidence decay**: older playbook entries receive lower relevance scores (30d: 0.8x, 90d: 0.5x)
- **Reinforcement**: successful patterns are boosted via reinforcement memories
- **Mid-task correction detection**: regex-based detection of user corrections during execution
- **`/learn` skill**: manually teach the agent insights, corrections, preferences, or rules

See [Self-Improving Agent](self-improving-agent.md) for the full architecture guide.

### Evolving Agent Intelligence

A set of connected subsystems that make improvement visible and measurable over time.

| Subsystem | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Unified Memory Synthesizer** | Collects 7 memory sources (user profile, relationship, playbook, memory, knowledge graph, workspace kit, daily summaries), deduplicates by 120-char fingerprint, ranks by `relevance × 0.45 + confidence × 0.3 + recency × 0.25`, and assembles a single token-budgeted `<cowork_synthesized_memory>` block injected into every task. |
| **Adaptive Style Engine** | Observes message length, emoji usage, technical vocabulary, and structured feedback to gradually shift personality settings (response length, emoji usage, explanation depth). Rate-limited to a configurable number of level-shifts per week. |
| **Playbook-to-Skill Promotion** | When a playbook pattern is reinforced 3+ times, auto-generates a `skill_proposal` for admin review. No skill is created until explicitly approved. |
| **Channel Persona Adapter** | Applies channel-appropriate communication directives (Slack = terse/structured, email = formal/greeting+sign-off, WhatsApp = short/emoji, etc.) on top of the core persona without replacing it. |
| **Evolution Metrics** | Computes 5 on-demand metrics: Correction Rate, Style Adaptations, Knowledge Graph growth, Task Success Rate, and Style Alignment. Produces an overall 0–100 Evolution Score. Surfaced in the Daily Briefing. |
| **Daily Operational Log** | `DailyLogService` writes structured per-day entries (task, feedback, decision, observation) to `.cowork/memory/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` for use by the summarizer. Raw logs are never injected into prompts. |
| **Daily Log Summarizer** | Reads pre-written daily summary files from `.cowork/memory/summaries/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`, applies recency decay (half-life: 7 days), and returns ranked `MemoryFragment` objects that enter the Memory Synthesizer pipeline. |

**Behavior Adaptation controls** (Settings > Guardrails > Behavior Adaptation):
- **Adaptive Style** toggle — enable/disable style learning (off by default)
- **Max drift per week** — maximum one-level style shifts per 7-day window (default: 1)
- **Reset learned style** — clears all accumulated style adaptations
- **Channel Persona** toggle — enable/disable per-channel communication adaptation (off by default)

See [Evolving Agent Intelligence](evolving-agent-intelligence.md) and [Behavior Adaptation](behavior-adaptation.md) for full details.

## Knowledge Graph

SQLite-backed structured entity and relationship memory with full-text search and graph traversal.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **10 built-in entity types** | person, organization, project, technology, concept, file, service, api_endpoint, database_table, environment |
| **15 built-in edge types** | uses, depends_on, part_of, created_by, maintained_by, deployed_to, and more |
| **FTS5 search** | Full-text search with BM25 ranking over entity names and descriptions |
| **Graph traversal** | Iterative BFS up to 3 hops with edge type filtering |
| **Observations** | Append-only timestamped fact log per entity |
| **Auto-extraction** | Regex-based entity extraction from completed task results |
| **Confidence decay** | Auto-extracted entities decay over time (floor: 0.3) |
| **9 agent tools** | kg_create_entity, kg_update_entity, kg_delete_entity, kg_create_edge, kg_delete_edge, kg_add_observation, kg_search, kg_get_neighbors, kg_get_subgraph |
| **Context injection** | Relevant entities auto-injected into task system prompts |

See [Knowledge Graph](knowledge-graph.md) for the full architecture guide.

## Workspace Kit (.cowork)

Initialize and maintain a `.cowork/` directory inside each workspace for durable, human-edited context, scoped prompt injection, project scaffolding, and workspace health checks.

The workspace kit is contract-driven: every tracked markdown file has a declared title, scope, parser, prompt budget, freshness window, mutability model, and optional special handling.

### Root workspace files

| File | Title | Scope | Parser | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Workspace Rules | `task`, `main-session` | `sectioned` | workspace-wide operating guidance and coordination rules |
| `MEMORY.md` | Long-Term Memory | `task`, `main-session` | `decision-log` | durable learnings and long-lived constraints |
| `USER.md` | User Profile | `task`, `main-session` | `kv-lines` | preferences, timezone, communication defaults |
| `TOOLS.md` | Local Setup Notes | `task`, `main-session` | `sectioned` | environment notes, common commands, local conventions |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Workspace Identity | `task`, `main-session`, `role` | `kv-lines` | who the agent is and what it owns |
| `RULES.md` | Operational Rules | `task`, `main-session`, `role`, `company-ops` | `checklist` | must/must-not behavior and approval defaults |
| `SOUL.md` | Workspace Persona | `task`, `main-session`, `role` | `sectioned` | tone, collaboration style, execution philosophy |

| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Heartbeat Checklist | `heartbeat` | `checklist` | recurring Heartbeat v3 checklist work |

### Project and role subdirectories

- Project-specific context lives under `.cowork/projects/<projectId>/`
- `CONTEXT.md` is the project-scoped task brief, decisions, and notes file
- `ACCESS.md` is the project-scoped access and boundary file for task and role usage
- Per-role persona files live under `.cowork/agents/<roleId>/`
- The health model also tracks supporting directories such as `.cowork/memory/`, `.cowork/memory/hourly/`, `.cowork/memory/weekly/`, `.cowork/projects/`, and `.cowork/agents/`

### Frontmatter, parsing, and injection

Tracked files can begin with simple frontmatter:

```md
---
updated: 2026-03-14
---
```

- `updated` is expected on files with freshness windows so the app can mark stale context correctly
- Bodies are sanitized and redacted before prompt injection
- Oversized files are truncated to each file's prompt budget and reported with a truncation warning
- Parsers are file-specific: `sectioned` for heading-based notes, `kv-lines` for filled key/value fields, `checklist` for rules and recurring lists, and `decision-log` for durable bullet-style history

### Special handling

- `BOOTSTRAP.md` is onboarding-only context, not a durable memory file
- When `BOOTSTRAP.md` is first present, CoWork OS records `bootstrapSeededAt` in `.cowork/workspace-state.json`
- When `BOOTSTRAP.md` is later removed, CoWork OS records `onboardingCompletedAt` and does not recreate it during missing-only init flows
- `HEARTBEAT.md` is reserved for recurring Heartbeat v3 checklist work and is intentionally separate from general task/session context

### Health, linting, and revisions

- The app surfaces workspace-kit health with missing tracked entries, stale files, warning/error counts, revision counts, and onboarding metadata
- `ACCESS.md` and `TOOLS.md` receive additional secret detection to catch likely credentials or copied tokens
- Tracked writes keep snapshots under `.cowork/**/.history/<file>/` together with revision metadata
- `search_memories` indexes `.cowork/` markdown alongside the main memory system
- `npm run kit:lint` validates the current workspace kit from the command line
- `npm run kit:lint -- --json` emits raw status JSON
- `npm run kit:lint -- --strict` exits non-zero on warnings or missing tracked entries

### Quick-open kit files

The Memory Hub exposes **Open USER.md** and **Open MEMORY.md** buttons that open the corresponding `.cowork/` file directly in the system editor. If the file does not exist it is created from a default template (with full frontmatter and section scaffolding) before opening.

Configure in **Settings** > **Memory Hub**.

---

## Role Profile Files

Define per-role personality and operating guidelines in `.cowork/agents/<role-id>/`. These files reuse the same contracts, parser rules, and titles as the root workspace kit, and role/task prompts can combine role files with root workspace files when scopes match.

| File | Title | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IDENTITY.md` | Workspace Identity | role identity, ownership boundaries, confirmation rules |
| `RULES.md` | Operational Rules | role-specific must/must-not behavior and safety defaults |
| `SOUL.md` | Workspace Persona | collaboration style, tone, execution philosophy |
| `VIBES.md` | Current Operating Mode | current emphasis, urgency, and optimization target |

---

## Agent Teams

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Team Management** | Create and manage teams with multiple agent members |
| **Persistent Teams** | Mark teams as persistent so they survive across sessions with a default workspace |
| **Shared Checklists** | Agents share checklist items for coordinated task execution |
| **Run Tracking** | Track team runs with status, progress, and history |
| **Collaborative Mode** | Ephemeral teams with real-time thought sharing |
| **Multi-LLM Mode** | Dispatch same task to multiple providers with judge-based synthesis |
| **Collaborative Thoughts** | Real-time thought panel shows agent reasoning as it happens |

Configure in **Mission Control** > **Teams**.

---

## Mission Control

Centralized agent orchestration and monitoring dashboard. Access from **Settings** > **Mission Control**.

| Panel | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Agents** | Active agents list with status dots, Pulse/Dispatch state, cadence, and manual trigger controls |
| **Mission Queue** | 5-column Kanban board (Inbox → Assigned → In Progress → Review → Done) with drag-and-drop |
| **Feed & Details** | Real-time activity feed with event type and agent filters, plus task detail view with comments and mentions |

**Header controls:** Agent Teams management, Performance Reviews, Standup Report generation, and workspace selector with live stats (active agents, queued tasks, pending mentions).

All panels update in real-time via event subscriptions — no manual refresh needed.

**Dispatched Agents Progress:** When you mention agents in a task prompt (e.g. `@Security Analyst review this codebase`), the parent task's main window shows a live progress panel with:
- Agent chips showing each dispatched agent's status (working/completed/failed)
- Phase indicator (Dispatched → Working → Complete)
- Real-time event stream from all child agent tasks (plans, steps, results)
- Click any agent chip to jump to that agent's full task view

Cancelling a parent task automatically cascades to all dispatched child tasks.

See [Mission Control](mission-control.md) for the full guide.

## Digital Twins (Persona Templates)

Create role-specific AI digital twins from pre-built persona templates. Each twin absorbs cognitively draining tasks so the human stays in flow. Accessible via the **"Add Digital Twin"** button in Mission Control's agents panel.

### Templates (10 roles, 5 categories)

| Category | Templates |
|----------|-----------|
| **Engineering** | Software Engineer, Hardware Engineer, QA/Test Engineer, DevOps/SRE, Technical Writer |
| **Management** | Engineering Manager, Technical Director, VP Engineering |
| **Product** | Product Manager |
| **Data & Analytics** | Data Scientist / Analyst |

### What Each Template Includes

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **System Prompt** | Role-tailored persona with behavior guidelines |
| **Capabilities** | Skill tags (code, review, test, analyze, document, etc.) |
| **Proactive Tasks** | Heartbeat v3 tasks evaluated in Pulse and escalated only when justified |
| **Cognitive Offload** | Categorized by mental burden relieved: context switching, status reporting, review prep, decision prep, documentation, dependency tracking |
| **Recommended Skills** | Pre-mapped skills with required/optional flags |
| **Autonomy Level** | `specialist` (IC roles) or `lead` (management roles) |

### Activation Flow

1. Click **"Add Digital Twin"** in Mission Control agents panel
2. Browse the **template gallery** — filter by category or search by name/tags
3. Click a template card to open the **activation dialog**
4. Customize: twin name, Pulse cadence (5min–4hr), heartbeat profile, and proactive tasks
5. Click **"Create Digital Twin"** — creates a new AgentRole with Heartbeat v3 defaults

The twin appears in the agents panel and begins running cheap Pulse checks on the configured cadence, escalating only when Dispatch is warranted.

## Build Mode

Dedicated "idea → working prototype" workflow powered by Live Canvas with four phases:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Concept** | Restate the idea, identify core requirements, choose tech stack |
| **Plan** | Break down into components, define file structure, outline implementation |
| **Scaffold** | Generate working code, push to canvas, create checkpoint |
| **Iterate** | Refine based on feedback, add features, polish UI |

Each phase creates a named checkpoint. You can revert to any phase, diff between phases, and view the full phase timeline. Build Mode is available as a built-in skill (`build-mode`).

See [Live Canvas](live-canvas.md) for the full guide.

---

## Usage Insights

Dashboard showing task activity, cost trends, agent efficiency, and productivity patterns. Access from **Settings** > **Usage Insights**.

### Overview

The panel opens with a **hero stats row** showing four key metrics at a glance:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Completed** | Total tasks completed in the selected period |
| **Success Rate** | Percentage of completed tasks out of total, with a color-coded progress bar (green ≥ 70%, amber ≥ 40%, red < 40%) |
| **Failed** | Total failed tasks |
| **Avg Time** | Average completion time across completed tasks |

Below the hero row, detailed sections are arranged in a **two-column grid** for information density.

### Workspace Filtering

The workspace dropdown at the top lets you filter insights to a single workspace or view **All Workspaces** (the default). "All Workspaces" aggregates metrics across every workspace, giving you a global view of your agent usage.

### Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Cost & Tokens** | Total cost, input/output token counts, and cost breakdown by model |
| **Agent Efficiency (AWU)** | Agentic Work Unit metrics — see below |
| **Activity by Day** | Tasks per day-of-week with peak day indicator |
| **Activity by Hour** | Hourly task histogram with peak hour indicator |
| **Top Skills** | Most-used skills ranked by usage count |
| **Skill Usage by Pack** | Skills grouped by their parent plugin pack with aggregated usage counts and mini bar charts |

### Agentic Work Units (AWU)

Inspired by [Salesforce's AWU concept](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/agentic-work-unit/), an **Agentic Work Unit** represents one successfully completed unit of agent work.

**Definition:** 1 AWU = 1 task with `status = 'completed'` AND `terminal_status` of `ok` or `partial_success`.

The AWU section shows:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AWU Count** | Number of completed work units in the period |
| **Tokens per AWU** | Total tokens consumed ÷ AWU count (lower is more efficient) |
| **Cost per AWU** | Total cost ÷ AWU count (lower is cheaper) |
| **AWUs per Dollar** | AWU count ÷ total cost (higher is better ROI) |
| **Efficiency Trend** | Percentage change in tokens/AWU and cost/AWU vs the previous period. A downward arrow (green) means improvement; upward (red) means regression |

The trend comparison uses the same period length — e.g., if you're viewing a 7-day window, it compares against the prior 7 days. The AWU section is hidden when no tasks were completed in the period.

### Period Selection

Supports **7-day**, **14-day**, and **30-day** windows. Per-pack analytics cross-reference skill usage with plugin pack membership, showing which packs drive the most value.

---

## Daily Briefing

Proactive morning briefing combining:

- **Task summary**: Completed in last 24 hours, currently in progress, scheduled for today
- **Recent highlights**: Key insights and decisions from memory
- **Suggested priorities**: Based on user profile goals, or sensible defaults

Configurable as a scheduled task in **Settings** > **Scheduled Tasks** with time picker and channel delivery.

---

## Citation Engine

Automatic source attribution for web research. When agents use `web_search` or `web_fetch`, the Citation Engine tracks and deduplicates all referenced URLs, assigning sequential citation indices.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-tracking** | Intercepts results from `web_search` and `web_fetch` tools |
| **Deduplication** | Same URL referenced multiple times gets a single [N] index |
| **System prompt injection** | Formatted citation list injected into LLM context so the agent can reference sources |
| **Citation panel** | UI panel showing all sources with URL, title, domain, snippet, and access timestamp |

Citations appear inline in agent responses as `[1]`, `[2]`, etc. and link to the source in the Citation Panel.

---

## Scratchpad Tools

Session-scoped note-taking system for agents during long-running tasks.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scratchpad_write` | Write or update notes with key-value pairs (max 100-char keys, 10,000-char values) |
| `scratchpad_read` | Retrieve all notes or a specific note by key |

Notes persist to `.cowork/scratchpad-{taskId}.json` for crash recovery. The scratchpad is ephemeral per task — useful for agents to track intermediate findings, partial results, and working state during complex multi-step tasks.

---

## Workflow Pipeline & Deep Work Mode

### Workflow Pipeline

Multi-phase task execution for complex workflows. The Workflow Decomposer detects multi-step prompts (using connectives like "then", "after that", "next", "finally") and splits them into sequential phases.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-detection** | Regex-based decomposition of multi-phase prompts |
| **5 phase types** | research, create, deliver, analyze, general |
| **Sequential execution** | Each phase creates a child task; output pipes into the next phase |
| **LLM fallback** | Complex prompts that resist regex decomposition use LLM-powered splitting |
| **Pipeline events** | `pipeline_started`, `phase_started`, `phase_completed`, `pipeline_completed` |

### Deep Work Mode

Extended execution mode for complex tasks that need sustained focus:

- **Extended timeouts** — Deep work tasks get longer execution budgets
- **Progress journaling** — Agent records progress notes during execution, visible in the task timeline
- **Memory compression pause** — Memory service pauses background compression during active deep work to avoid context disruption

---

## Document Generation Tools

Three dedicated agent tools for generating formatted documents from task context:

| Tool | Output | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `generate_document` | PDF | Generate PDF documents with markdown content and structured sections |
| `generate_presentation` | PPTX | Generate PowerPoint presentations with multiple slides |
| `generate_spreadsheet` | XLSX | Generate Excel spreadsheets with multiple sheets and data |

These tools complement the existing document skills (spreadsheet.ts, document.ts, presentation.ts) by providing direct LLM-callable tool interfaces. Generated files are registered as task artifacts with proper MIME types.

---

## Event Triggers

Condition-based automation engine that fires actions in response to events.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Trigger sources** | Channel gateway messages, cron service, webhooks |
| **Action types** | `create_task`, `send_message`, `wake_agent` |
| **Condition logic** | "all" (AND) evaluation of multiple conditions |
| **Cooldown** | Configurable cooldown period (default 1 min) to prevent rapid re-firing |
| **Variable substitution** | Event data can be injected into action prompts/titles |
| **History** | Last 50 fires per trigger stored for audit |

Configure in **Settings** > **Event Triggers**.

---

## File Hub

| **Health check** | Unauthenticated `/api/health` endpoint for monitoring |

Configure in **Settings** > **Web Access**.

---

## Vision Tools

Multi-provider image and PDF analysis with caching and optimization.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `analyze_image` | Analyze any image with vision LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock) |
| `read_pdf_visual` | Convert PDF pages to images and analyze layout/design |

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Result caching** | SHA1-keyed cache (128 entries) prevents redundant vision API calls |
| **Auto-downscaling** | Images >2MB automatically downscaled to 1600×1200 at 80% quality |
| **Multi-provider fallback** | OpenAI → Anthropic → Gemini → Bedrock fallback chain |
| **Retry logic** | Transient errors (429, 5xx, timeouts) trigger single retry |
| **PDF conversion** | Uses `pdftoppm` to convert PDF pages to PNG at 72 DPI (5-page max) |

---

## Adaptive Complexity

Three-tier UI density controlling which features and settings are visible:

| Tier | Description |

See [Live Canvas](live-canvas.md) for the full guide.

---

## Browser Automation

Three-tier web interaction stack — from lightweight HTTP fetching to full browser automation to anti-bot scraping — all as native agent tools with no external CLI dependencies.

### Web Search (5 providers, always available)

Multi-provider web search with automatic fallback. DuckDuckGo is built-in and requires no API key, so `web_search` works out of the box for every user.

| Provider | Types | API Key | Notes |
|----------|-------|---------|-------|
| **DuckDuckGo** | Web | Not required | Built-in free fallback, always last in chain |
| **Tavily** | Web, News | Required | AI-optimized results (recommended) |
| **Brave Search** | Web, News, Images | Required | Privacy-focused |
| **SerpAPI** | Web, News, Images | Required | Google results |
| **Google Custom Search** | Web, Images | Required | Direct Google integration |

Paid providers are tried first in configured order. DuckDuckGo is automatically appended as the last-resort fallback. Includes retry with exponential backoff for transient errors.

### Architecture

```
Tier 0: web_search                   (multi-provider search — always available)
Tier 1: web_fetch / http_request     (no browser — fastest)
Tier 2: browser_* tools              (Playwright in-process — full interaction)
Tier 3: scrape_* tools               (Scrapling — anti-bot bypass)
```

The agent auto-selects the appropriate tier: `web_search` for discovering information, `web_fetch` for reading known URLs, `browser_*` when interaction or JS rendering is needed, and `scrape_*` for anti-bot-protected sites.

### Browser Tools (19 tools — native Playwright)

Native Playwright API integration — no CLI subprocess, no process spawning overhead.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browser_attach` | Attach to existing Chrome via Chrome DevTools Protocol (signed-in sessions). See [Chrome DevTools attach](#chrome-devtools-attach-mode) below. |
| `browser_act_batch` | Execute batched actions (click, fill, type, press, wait, scroll) in sequence with optional delays |
| `browser_navigate` | Navigate to URL with configurable wait states (load, networkidle, domcontentloaded) |
| `browser_screenshot` | Capture viewport or full-page screenshots |
| `browser_get_content` | Extract text, links, and form data from current page |
| `browser_click` | Click elements via CSS selectors |
| `browser_fill` | Fill form fields (clears existing text) |
| `browser_type` | Type text character-by-character (triggers autocomplete/key events) |
| `browser_press` | Press keyboard keys (Enter, Tab, Escape, shortcuts) |
| `browser_wait` | Wait for element visibility with timeout |
| `browser_scroll` | Scroll page (up, down, top, bottom) |
| `browser_select` | Select dropdown options |
| `browser_get_text` | Extract text from specific elements |
| `browser_evaluate` | Execute JavaScript in browser context |
| `browser_back` | Navigate browser history back |
| `browser_forward` | Navigate browser history forward |
| `browser_reload` | Reload the current page |
| `browser_save_pdf` | Save page as PDF file |
| `browser_close` | Close browser session and free resources |

### Web Fetch Tools (2 tools)

Lightweight HTTP without browser overhead — preferred for reading known URLs.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `web_fetch` | Fetch URL → HTML-to-Markdown conversion with optional CSS selector filtering |
| `http_request` | Raw HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS) with custom headers/body |

### Chrome DevTools Attach Mode

Attach to an existing Chrome instance to control a signed-in browser session (e.g. Gmail, social media). Uses the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

**Setup:**

1. Launch Chrome with remote debugging: `chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222` (or add `--remote-debugging-port=9222` to your Chrome shortcut).
2. Visit [chrome://inspect/#devices](chrome://inspect/#devices) to verify the endpoint.
3. The agent uses `browser_attach` with `debugger_url: "http://localhost:9222"` (or the WebSocket URL from the version endpoint).
4. After attach, `browser_navigate` and other browser tools operate on the attached session.

See [Chrome Remote Debugging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/) for full setup guides.

**Profile presets vs attach mode:** Use `browser_attach` with `debugger_url` when you want to control an **already running** signed-in Chrome session. Use `profile="user"` when you want to **launch a new** Chrome instance with your system profile — but Chrome must not already be running with that profile (profile lock). For existing sessions, attach mode is the correct choice.

**Note:** If you close the Chrome window while attached, subsequent browser actions will fail with "Target closed". Re-attach with `browser_attach` after relaunching Chrome.

### Browser Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multi-Browser** | Chromium (bundled), Chrome (system), Brave (auto-discovered) |
| **Profile Presets** | `user` (launch new Chrome with system profile — fails if Chrome is already running), `chrome-relay` (extension relay), `workspace` (workspace default). For existing signed-in sessions, use `browser_attach` instead. |
| **Persistent Profiles** | Cookies and storage persist across tasks in `.cowork/browser-profiles/` |
| **Consent Auto-Dismiss** | 40+ pattern detectors for cookie/GDPR consent popups |
| **Retry Logic** | 2-attempt retry with per-attempt timeout calculation |
| **Failure Diagnostics** | Screenshot + page content + URL captured on failure |
| **Domain Guardrails** | Whitelist enforcement via GuardrailManager |
| **Headless/Headed** | Toggle visible browser window for debugging |
| **Configurable Timeouts** | Per-tool `timeout_ms` parameter (default: 90s) |

### Comparison with ClawHub Agent Browser

| Capability | ClawHub Agent Browser | CoWork OS Browser |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | External Rust CLI, commands via Bash shell | Native Playwright API, in-process (no spawning) |
| **Performance** | CLI process spawn per command + JSON serialization | Direct API calls, persistent browser instance |
| **Navigation** | `open`, `back`, `forward`, `reload` | `browser_navigate`, `browser_back`, `browser_forward`, `browser_reload` |
| **Element interaction** | 12 commands (click, fill, type, hover, drag, check, select, etc.) | 6 tools (click, fill, type, press, scroll, select) |
| **Page analysis** | Accessibility tree snapshots with `@ref` identifiers | Content extraction (text + links + forms), element text |
| **Screenshots/PDF** | Screenshot + full-page + PDF export | `browser_screenshot` (viewport/full) + `browser_save_pdf` |
| **JavaScript** | `eval "expression"` | `browser_evaluate` (full JS execution) |
| **Wait strategies** | Element, text, URL, network idle, JS condition | Element visibility with timeout |
| **Tabs/frames** | Tab management, iframe switching | Single-page focus |
| **State management** | `state save/load` JSON files | Persistent browser profiles (automatic) |
| **Network interception** | Route, mock, block requests | Not exposed as tools |
| **Video recording** | `record start/stop` to WebM | Not available |
| **Device emulation** | Presets ("iPhone 14"), geolocation, viewport | Viewport configurable |
| **Cookies/storage** | Manual cookie and localStorage management | Automatic via persistent profiles |
| **Anti-bot bypass** | None | Scrapling integration (TLS fingerprinting, Cloudflare bypass) |
| **Consent popups** | None | Auto-dismissal with 40+ pattern detectors |
| **Retry on failure** | None (single attempt) | 2-attempt retry with diagnostics |
| **Domain guardrails** | None | Whitelist enforcement |
| **Lightweight fetch** | None (always launches browser) | `web_fetch` for reads without browser overhead |
| **Multi-browser** | Playwright only | Chromium, Chrome, Brave |
| **Integration** | Loose (CLI → Bash → agent) | Tight (in-process, daemon logging, artifact registry) |

**Key advantage:** CoWork OS's in-process Playwright approach avoids the overhead of spawning a CLI process per command while providing tighter integration with the agent runtime (retry logic, failure diagnostics, domain guardrails, consent auto-dismiss). The three-tier architecture also means the agent doesn't launch a browser when a simple HTTP fetch suffices.

## Infrastructure

Built-in cloud infrastructure tools registered as native agent tools — no MCP subprocess, no external dependency at runtime. The agent can provision cloud resources, manage domains, and make payments directly.

### How It Works

Infrastructure tools are registered in the Tool Registry alongside file, shell, and browser tools. When the agent needs cloud resources, it calls these tools directly — no subprocess overhead, no external server. All credentials are stored encrypted in the OS keychain via SecureSettingsRepository.

### Benefits

- **Zero latency overhead**: Tools execute in-process, no MCP subprocess or network hop
- **Unified approval flow**: Payment and registration operations use the same approval dialogs as shell commands and file deletions
- **Encrypted credentials**: API keys and wallet private keys stored via OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI, Linux libsecret)
- **Provider-based architecture**: Swap E2B for another sandbox provider, or Namecheap for Cloudflare — each capability is a pluggable provider class

### Cloud Sandboxes (E2B)

Spin up isolated Linux VMs for running code, deploying services, or testing in a clean environment.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cloud_sandbox_create` | Create a new sandbox (name, timeout, env vars) |
| `cloud_sandbox_exec` | Run a shell command in a sandbox |
| `cloud_sandbox_write_file` | Write a file into a sandbox |
| `cloud_sandbox_read_file` | Read a file from a sandbox |
| `cloud_sandbox_list` | List all active sandboxes |
| `cloud_sandbox_delete` | Delete a sandbox and free resources |
| `cloud_sandbox_url` | Get the public URL for an exposed port |

Sandboxes auto-expire per E2B tier (5 min default, configurable up to 60 min on free tier). E2B provides $100 free credits with no credit card required.

### Domain Registration (Namecheap)

Search, register, and manage domains and DNS records.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `domain_search` | Search available domains across TLDs (.com, .io, .ai, .dev, etc.) |
| `domain_register` | Register a domain (requires user approval) |
| `domain_list` | List all registered domains |
| `domain_dns_list` | List DNS records for a domain |
| `domain_dns_add` | Add a DNS record (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS) |
| `domain_dns_delete` | Delete a DNS record |

Domain registration requires explicit user approval before any purchase is made.

### Wallet & Payments

Built-in USDC wallet on Base network for infrastructure payments.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `wallet_info` | Get wallet address, network, and USDC balance |
| `wallet_balance` | Get current USDC balance |
| `x402_check` | Check if a URL requires x402 payment |
| `x402_fetch` | Fetch a URL with automatic x402 payment (requires approval) |

The wallet is auto-generated on first setup, with the private key encrypted in the OS keychain. The wallet address and balance are displayed in the sidebar. x402 is an HTTP-native payment protocol where the agent signs EIP-712 typed data to authorize USDC payments on Base — useful for paying for API access, premium content, or compute resources.

### Status & Configuration

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `infra_status` | Get overall status: provider connections, active sandboxes, wallet state |

Configure in **Settings** > **Infrastructure**. The settings UI shows:
- Provider connection status (E2B, Namecheap, Wallet)
- API key configuration for each provider
- Wallet address with copy button and balance display
- Tool category toggles (enable/disable sandbox, domain, or payment tools independently)
- Coinbase Agentic Wallet remote signer configuration (`wallet.provider = coinbase_agentic`) — see [Coinbase Agentic Signer Contract](coinbase-agentic-signer.md)

## Web Browser Mode (Planned)

Access CoWork OS from any web browser — no Electron desktop app required.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **How** | `cowork-os --serve --port 3000` starts a Node.js server exposing the full React UI over HTTP/WebSocket |
| **Approach** | Reuses all existing main-process logic (agent, tools, database, gateways). IPC calls are mapped to HTTP/WebSocket endpoints |
| **Desktop features** | System tray, desktop screenshots, and AppleScript degrade gracefully. File dialogs use browser-native pickers |
| **Security** | Challenge-response authentication (extends existing control plane auth). HTTPS recommended for production |
| **Existing foundation** | Control plane already serves a web dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`. Web mode extends this to the full React UI |

See [Architecture: Web Browser Mode](architecture.md#web-browser-mode-planned--serve) for the implementation plan.

---

## WebSocket Control Plane

- Web dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`

| Mode | Binding | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Local Only** | `127.0.0.1:18789` | Desktop automation |
| **LAN Access** | `0.0.0.0:18789` | Mobile companions |

Configure in **Settings** > **Control Plane**.
