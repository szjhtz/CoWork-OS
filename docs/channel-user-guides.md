# Channel User Guides

This guide explains how to use each CoWork messaging channel after it is connected. It focuses on end-user behavior, best practices, and channel-specific strengths rather than setup details.

For setup steps, see [Channel Integrations](channels.md). For shared command behavior, see [Gateway Message Lifecycle](gateway-message-lifecycle.md). For daily command examples, see [Using CoWork from WhatsApp and Other Channels](gateway-user-guide.md).

## Shared Usage Model

All messaging channels use the same core gateway model:

- Send a normal message to start a task.
- Send normal text during a running task to add a follow-up.
- Use `/new` to make the next message start fresh without cancelling the old task.
- Use `/stop` or `/cancel` to stop the active task.
- Use `/commands` for the command catalog.
- Use `/skills` to see enabled skills and `/<skill-slug> args` to run one where the platform delivers typed slash text.
- Scheduled results, final answers, approvals, cancellations, and task progress are delivered back through the same channel delivery path.

Best practices for every channel:

- Pick one channel per workflow when possible so context stays coherent.
- Select the workspace before asking CoWork to edit project files.
- Use `/new` before changing topics.
- Use `/new temp` for scratch work that should not attach to a normal project workspace.
- Use `/stop` when the current task should not continue.
- Use `/queue <message>` or `/steer <guidance>` when an active task needs explicit direction.
- Keep high-risk approvals in direct messages or private channels.

## WhatsApp

Best for:

- Personal mobile control from the "Message Yourself" chat.
- Quick task starts, follow-ups, approvals, and daily briefs.
- Lightweight research channels where groups post links for later analysis.

Features:

- QR-based WhatsApp Web connection.
- Self-chat mode for personal use.
- Natural shortcuts such as `help`, `status`, `new task`, `new temp`, `stop`, `queue ...`, and `background ...`.
- Typing indicators.
- Editable progress messages where provider support allows it.
- Optional response prefix to distinguish CoWork replies.
- Link-research group support.

Best practices:

- Use self-chat mode when connecting your personal WhatsApp number.
- Use a short response prefix if CoWork replies are hard to distinguish from your own messages.
- Use `/new temp` for quick experiments, drafts, and one-off analysis.
- Use `/workspaces` only for real workspaces; temporary workspaces are intentionally hidden.
- In groups, choose a routing mode that matches the room: mention/command routing for busy groups, all-message routing for dedicated task rooms.
- Keep approvals in self-chat or trusted groups.

Watch-outs:

- WhatsApp is excellent for compact task control, but not ideal for long code review output.
- Group routing can become noisy if every message is routed to CoWork.
- Media behavior should stay simple: attach files when needed, but use a desktop workspace for large file-heavy workflows.

## Telegram

Best for:

- Power users who want a native slash menu.
- Private bot chats for task control.
- Groups that need configurable mention/command routing.
- Link-research rooms.

Features:

- Bot command menu populated with core remote commands.
- DM, group, and topic/thread support where Telegram provides context.
- Group routing modes: all, mentions only, mentions or commands, commands only.
- Allowed group chat IDs.
- Reactions and draft-style streaming behavior for responsive feedback.
- Attachment and voice handling where supported.

Best practices:

- Use the Telegram `/` menu for common commands such as `/new`, `/stop`, `/queue`, `/steer`, and `/background`.
- In groups, use commands-only or mentions-or-commands mode unless the group is dedicated to CoWork tasks.
- Use `/queue <message>` when adding context from a busy group.
- Use `/steer <guidance>` for task-critical corrections.
- Use dedicated research groups for link capture instead of mixing research links into general task rooms.

Watch-outs:

- Telegram groups can have many messages quickly; permissive routing may create unintended tasks.
- If multiple users share one group session, agree on who owns task direction before approving actions.
- Long outputs are better summarized in Telegram and inspected in the desktop app when detail matters.

## Discord

Best for:

- Team or community workspaces.
- Engineering groups that want native slash commands, threads, and richer task interactions.
- Supervisor-style workflows with dedicated coordination channels.
- Fetching live Discord messages and attachments for agent context.

Features:

- Native slash commands for core lifecycle controls.
- DM and server channel support.
- Guild allowlists.
- Thread-aware routing where Discord provides thread context.
- Buttons, select menus, embeds, and approval controls.
- Live Discord message fetch and attachment download tools.
- Optional supervisor mode for structured worker/supervisor operations.
- `/task <prompt>` compatibility shortcut for starting a task from native slash UI.

Best practices:

- Use `/new mode:temp` for scratch tasks from Discord.
- Use `/status` for state and `/commands` for the command catalog.
- Use `/task prompt:...` only when you intentionally want to start task text from the Discord slash UI.
- Use threads for focused task discussions.
- Restrict guild IDs if the bot is installed in multiple servers.
- Keep supervisor mode in dedicated channels so normal chat does not mix with coordination protocol messages.

Watch-outs:

- Discord slash commands must be registered and may take time to propagate globally.
- Message Content Intent must be enabled for normal text routing.
- In large servers, avoid all-channel access unless the bot is meant to be broadly available.

## Slack

Best for:

- Workplace teams that already coordinate in Slack.
- Channel mentions and direct-message workflows.
- Curated task progress in shared operational channels.
- Multi-workspace Slack installations in one CoWork profile.

Features:

- Socket Mode integration.
- DM and `@mention` routing.
- Registered Slack slash command payload routing.
- Multiple Slack workspace installations.
- File uploads.
- Editable progress messages in curated progress mode.
- Optional minimal or curated progress relay.

Best practices:

- Register the core Slack slash commands you want users to see, such as `/new`, `/stop`, `/commands`, `/queue`, `/steer`, and `/background`.
- Use DMs for personal tasks and approvals.
- Use channel mentions for shared tasks.
- Use curated progress in operational channels where short status updates are valuable.
- Use minimal progress in noisy channels.
- Keep one Slack channel tied to one kind of recurring work when possible.

Watch-outs:

- Slack does not deliver unregistered slash commands to CoWork.
- Socket Mode still requires correct app-level and bot tokens.
- Avoid broad channel access if only a few channels should route tasks.

- File attachment support.
- Auto-reconnect behavior.

Best practices:

- Use DMs for personal tasks, approvals, and sensitive context.
- Use channel mentions for shared work.
- Keep Teams app installation scoped to the teams/channels that should use CoWork.
- Use `/new` before switching from one operational topic to another.
- Use scheduled delivery for routine summaries into team channels.

Watch-outs:

- Setup depends on Azure Bot credentials and Teams channel configuration.
- Tenant and app policies can affect whether users can install or message the bot.
- Long outputs are usually better summarized in-channel with details available in CoWork.
