# Use Cases: Capability Map + Test Prompts

This doc provides copy-paste prompts you can run to validate each flow end-to-end.

## Ideas Panel

The **Ideas** tab in the sidebar shows use case prompts that use built-in capabilities (channels, inbox, /inbox, /brief, /simplify, /batch, browser, file I/O). See [Ideas Capabilities](ideas-capabilities.md) for what’s supported. Advanced use cases (e.g. legal skills) require optional skills and are listed below as copy-paste prompts.

## Use Case Coverage (High Level)

Use cases:
- Stay on top of messages (reply drafting + send-on-confirmation)
- Monitor things (newsletters, transactions)
- Household logistics (capture tasks, keep you on track)
- Booking + forms (find availability, fill forms, stop before final submit)
- Visibility for others (daily digest to family)
- Inbox autopilot (triage, drafts, cleanup suggestions)
- Chief-of-staff briefing (morning executive brief)
- Dev task queue management (agent-ready backlog execution)
- Founder-directed autonomous company operations ("zero-human company" loop)
- Smart-home orchestration via integrations
- "Figure it out" fallback orchestration for hard tasks

Cowork OS supports these via:
- Channels: Slack, iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram, Email, etc.
- Scheduling: `/schedule ...` and `schedule_task`
- Inbox + briefing commands: `/inbox`, `/brief [morning|today|tomorrow|week]`
- Slash skill workflows: `/simplify [objective] ...` for quality passes and `/batch <objective> ...` for parallelizable migration/transform workflows
- Integrations: Notion, Gmail/Google Calendar (if configured), Apple Calendar/Reminders (macOS)
- Web automation: browser tools (plus MCP puppeteer fallback for some sites)
- Company-ops primitives: venture workspace kit, digital twin operators, strategic planner, and Mission Control ops monitoring

For the full founder-operated company recipe, see [Zero-Human Company Operations](zero-human-company.md).

## Test Prompts (Copy/Paste)

Notes:
- If you don't know a chat ID, the prompt below instructs the agent to use `channel_list_chats` first and ask you to pick a `chat_id`.
- For “stop before sending/booking”, the prompts explicitly force a confirmation gate.

### 1) Stay On Top Of Messages (Draft Reply, Ask Before Sending)

Prompt:
```
Use channel_list_chats for channel "imessage" (since "7d", limit 20). Show me the list and ask me which chat_id corresponds to the person I mean.
After I pick a chat_id, use channel_history (limit 40) to pull the recent conversation, summarize it, and draft 2 reply options.
STOP before sending. Ask me whether to send A, send B, or edit.
```

Variant (Slack):
```
Use channel_list_chats for channel "slack" (since "24h", limit 20). Ask me to pick the chat_id for the thread/channel I care about.
Then pull channel_history (limit 80) and draft a crisp reply (2 variants).
STOP before sending and ask me to confirm.
```

### 2) Monitor Things (Newsletter Digest)

Prompt:
```
Use channel_list_chats for channel "slack" (since "24h", limit 20). Ask me to pick the chat_id where newsletters arrive (Substack/email feed).
Then pull channel_history (limit 150, since "24h") and produce a digest: title/link (if present) + 1-2 sentence summary each.
Propose follow-ups, but do not take external actions unless I confirm.
```

Scheduled version (daily 8am):
```
/schedule daily 8am Summarize new newsletter items from the last 24h in this chat: {{chat_messages}}. Output a digest with links and 1-2 sentence summaries.
```

### 3) Monitor Things (Transaction Scan / Fraud Triage)

Prompt (email channel):
```
Use channel_list_chats for channel "email" (since "14d", limit 20). Ask me to pick the chat_id for my card/bank notifications.
Then pull channel_history (limit 200, since "14d") and extract transactions (date, merchant, amount, currency).
Flag anything suspicious (new merchant, rapid repeats, or unusually large amounts) and recommend next steps.
Do not contact anyone or send messages unless I confirm.
```

Prompt (Gmail integration, if configured):
```
Search my Gmail for transaction notifications from the last 14 days (Amex/bank keywords). Extract transactions into a table and flag suspicious charges.
Do not send emails or contact anyone unless I confirm.
```

### 4) Household Logistics (Capture To Notion + Reminders)

Prompt:
```
Turn this into tasks in my Notion database (ask me for the database_id if you don't already have it):

- Buy storage bins for garage
- Return Amazon package
- Book dentist appointment

For each task, create one Notion page (title = task). If a due date is implied, ask me to confirm it.
If Apple Reminders is available, also create reminders for any due tasks.
Return the created Notion page IDs/URLs and reminder IDs.
```

### 5) Booking + Forms (Find Availability, Cross-check Calendar, Stop Before Submit)

Prompt (OpenTable-style):
```
Open this URL and verify the venue name is correct:
https://www.opentable.com/r/amorim-luxury-group-lisboa

Find openings for 2 people in the next 14 days between 6:30pm and 8:30pm.
Cross-check my calendar for conflicts.
Propose the 3 best conflict-free options.
Persist the compiled options to reservation_options.json.
STOP before final booking and ask me to confirm.
```

### 6) Visibility For Others (Daily Digest Draft, Ask Before Sending)

Prompt:
```
Create a daily digest for "tomorrow" with:
- Calendar events (times + titles)
- Any reminders or scheduled tasks I should remember

Draft it as a short message I can send to my family.
STOP before sending and ask me to confirm the final message and where to send it.
```

### 7) Inbox Autopilot (Triage + Drafts + Cleanup, Ask Before Acting)

Prompt:
```
Run inbox triage for the last 24h.
Prefer gmail_action; if unavailable use email_imap_unread; if unavailable use Email channel history.

Classify each message as urgent, today, this-week, or no-action.
Output:
- Priority table
- Draft replies for urgent/today items
- Cleanup candidates (newsletter/promotions) with unsubscribe/archive suggestions
- Follow-up reminders to create

STOP before sending, unsubscribing, archiving, deleting, or labeling anything.
Ask me what to execute.
```

Command shortcut:
```
/inbox autopilot 180
```

### 8) Morning Briefing Agent (Chief Of Staff)

Prompt:
```
Create my morning chief-of-staff brief.
Include:
- Executive summary (3-6 bullets)
- Calendar risks/prep
- Inbox priorities
- Reminders/tasks due soon
- Optional ops signals if available (weather, urgent GitHub notifications, revenue/payment changes)
- Recommended next actions in urgency order

If any signal source is unavailable, add a Missing Data section.
Format for mobile reading.
```

Command shortcuts:
```
/brief morning
/brief schedule morning weekdays 08:00
```

### 9) Smart Home Brain (Integration-First, Confirm Before State Changes)

Prompt:
```
Act as a smart-home orchestrator for this request: "Set evening mode at home".
First discover available smart-home integrations/tools.
Then produce a dry-run action plan (device + action + expected effect + rollback).
Respect quiet hours 22:00-07:00.
STOP and ask me to confirm before any physical state change.
If integrations are missing, give me a setup checklist and fallback manual steps.
```

### 10) Dev Task Queue Agent (Queue + Parallel Execution + Progress)

Prompt:
```
Build a dev task queue for repo owner/repo from open high-priority issues.
For each item include acceptance criteria, dependencies, risk, and suggested owner (agent or human).
Run up to 8 tasks in parallel and provide progress checkpoints.
For any code changes, summarize diffs and STOP before merge/deploy unless I approve.
```

### 11) "Figure It Out" Agent (Fallback Orchestration)

Prompt:
```
Objective: book a table for 2 next week between 7pm-8:30pm and avoid calendar conflicts.

Try the direct path first. If it fails, switch methods/tools and keep an attempt log:
- attempt number
- method/tool used
- observed result
- failure/success reason

Use up to 3 fallback attempts.
Never claim success without evidence.
STOP before irreversible external actions and ask for confirmation.
```

### 12) Deterministic Slash Workflows (`/simplify` and `/batch`)

Prompt:
```
Run /simplify this migration summary for readability and concision while preserving intent.
Simplify to a concise format suitable for handoff.
```

Batch transform pattern:
```
Run /batch update docs and code references that refer to the old "execution pipeline" term:
- Keep behavior unchanged.
- Group edits by domain.
- Produce a per-file checklist and diff summary.
```

Command variants:
```
/simplify review this plan for clarity and edge-case coverage.
/batch migrate markdown architecture docs to the new naming standard --parallel 4 --domain writing --external confirm
```
