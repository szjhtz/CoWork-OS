# Self-Improving Agent Architecture

CoWork OS implements a multi-layered self-improvement system that learns from task outcomes, user corrections, and feedback patterns. Each layer operates independently and feeds into the next task's context via prompt injection.

```

## Layer 1: PlaybookService

**Purpose:** Captures what worked and what did not at the task level.

**Storage:** Tagged `[PLAYBOOK]` memories in MemoryService with type `insight`.

### Capture Triggers

- **Task success** — records approach, tools used, original request
- **Task failure** — records error category, attempted approach, lesson learned
- **Mid-task correction** — records user corrections detected during execution

### Error Classification

Failures are classified into 7 categories using regex-based pattern matching (no LLM calls):

| Category | Matches |
|----------|---------|
| `tool_failure` | Tool execution errors, command failures |
| `wrong_approach` | Invalid parameters, incorrect methods |
| `missing_context` | ENOENT, file not found, missing parameters |
| `permission_denied` | 403, EACCES, unauthorised access |
| `timeout` | ETIMEDOUT, deadline exceeded |
| `rate_limit` | 429, quota exceeded, billing errors |
| `user_correction` | `[CORRECTION]` tagged mid-task corrections |

### Time-Based Decay

When retrieving playbook context for a new task, entries receive a decay factor based on age:

- **0-30 days:** 1.0x (full relevance)
- **30-90 days:** 0.8x (slight penalty)
- **90+ days:** 0.5x (significant penalty)

This ensures the agent favours recent, proven patterns over stale ones.

### Reinforcement

When a task succeeds and similar playbook entries already exist, a `[PLAYBOOK] Reinforced pattern` memory is created. This naturally boosts proven approaches in future hybrid searches because more semantic overlap leads to higher ranking.

## Layer 2: MemoryService

**Purpose:** Core persistence layer with hybrid search.

**Key features:**
- Local embedding model for offline semantic search
- BM25 lexical search as complement
- Privacy filtering (auto-detects API keys, tokens, passwords, SSH keys)
- LLM-based compression for token efficiency (~10x reduction)
- Per-workspace settings (retention days, privacy mode, storage caps)

**Memory types:** `observation`, `decision`, `error`, `insight`, `summary`

**Agent-initiated save:** The `memory_save` tool allows agents to explicitly persist memories during task execution (types: `observation`, `decision`, `error`, `insight`). This closes the loop between automatic post-task capture and conscious mid-task learning — agents can now decide in real-time that something is worth remembering.

## Layer 3: UserProfileService

**Purpose:** Extracts and maintains user facts from conversation.

**Auto-extraction patterns:**
- **Name** — "my name is...", "call me..." (0.95 confidence, pinned)
- **Preferences** — "I prefer...", "I like...", "I dislike..." (0.75 confidence)
- **Location** — "I live in...", "I'm based in..." (0.7 confidence)
- **Goals** — "my goal is...", "I want to..." (0.65 confidence)

**Feedback ingestion:**
- Concise/detailed preference detection (0.85 confidence)
- Tone feedback (0.8 confidence)
- Rejected approach tracking (0.65 confidence)

**Confidence scoring:** 0-1 scale with `Math.max()` merge on duplicates. Facts sorted by pinned status, confidence, then recency.

## Layer 4: RelationshipMemoryService

**Purpose:** 5-layer relationship memory for continuity across sessions.

| Layer | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Identity** | Name, role, key identifiers | "Preferred name: Alex" |
| **Preferences** | Communication style, format | "Prefers concise responses" |
| **Context** | Current projects, team, company | "Building a SaaS product" |
| **History** | Completed tasks, past interactions | "Completed task: deploy API" |
| **Commitments** | Open reminders, due dates | "Remind me to review PR by Friday" |

## Layer 5: FeedbackService

**Purpose:** Institutional learning from rejected/edited decisions.

**Mechanisms:**
- Captures rejected/edited decisions with reason text
- Aggregates patterns with occurrence counts
- Writes weekly feedback JSON logs to `.cowork/feedback/`
- Updates `.cowork/MISTAKES.md` with auto-section markers
- Prunes patterns older than 90 days

## Learning Flows

### Task Success Flow

1. Task completes successfully
2. `PlaybookService.captureOutcome("success")` records approach + tools
3. `PlaybookService.reinforceEntry()` finds matching playbook entries and creates reinforcement memories
4. `RelationshipMemoryService.recordTaskCompletion()` updates history layer

### Task Failure Flow

1. Task fails with error
2. `PlaybookService.captureOutcome("failure", errorMessage)` classifies the error into one of 7 categories and records the entry
3. Error category provides category-specific recovery context in future tasks

### Mid-Task Correction Flow

1. User sends a corrective message during task execution (e.g., "no, do it this way", "that's wrong", "actually I meant...")
2. Correction detector (regex-based, 12 patterns) identifies the correction
3. `[CORRECTION]` tagged insight memory captured in MemoryService
4. Playbook failure entry created with `user_correction` category
5. Future similar tasks see the correction in playbook context and avoid repeating the mistake

### User Feedback Flow

1. User gives thumbs down / rejects a decision
2. `FeedbackService` captures the pattern with count
3. `UserProfileService.ingestUserFeedback()` extracts preference facts
4. `RelationshipMemoryService.ingestUserFeedback()` updates preference/history layers
5. `.cowork/MISTAKES.md` updated with aggregated pattern

### Agent-Initiated Memory Flow (via `memory_save` tool)

1. During task execution, agent identifies something worth remembering (pattern, decision rationale, error resolution, factual observation)
2. Agent calls `memory_save` with content and type (`observation`, `decision`, `error`, `insight`)
3. `MemoryService.capture()` stores the memory with workspace scope, auto-detects sensitive data, and generates local embeddings
4. Future tasks receive the memory via hybrid search in system prompt injection and via the `search_memories` tool

### Manual Learning Flow (via `/learn` skill)

1. User invokes `/learn` with an insight, correction, preference, or rule
2. Agent stores the learning via task execution (MemoryService capture)
3. Agent appends to `.cowork/MEMORY.md` for human-readable, cross-session persistence
4. Preferences also reach UserProfileService through normal message ingestion

## Privacy and Safety

- All memories pass through `SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` filter (20+ patterns for API keys, tokens, passwords, SSH keys, etc.)
- Private memories are not shared externally but remain available to the local agent
- Workspace-level privacy modes: Normal, Strict, Disabled
- Content sanitised via `InputSanitizer.sanitizeMemoryContent()` before prompt injection
- Error messages truncated to prevent sensitive data leakage in playbook entries

## Comparison with ClawHub "self-improving-agent"

ClawHub's `pskoett/self-improving-agent` (v1.0.11) is a Claude Code skill that "captures learnings, errors, and corrections to enable continuous improvement." CoWork OS's self-improvement system is architecturally more comprehensive:

| Capability | ClawHub Skill | CoWork OS |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Storage** | Flat file (likely LEARNINGS.md) | SQLite-backed MemoryService with hybrid semantic + BM25 search |
| **Memory layers** | Single file | 5 independent services (Playbook, Memory, UserProfile, Relationship, Feedback) |
| **Error classification** | None | 7 error categories with regex-based classification |
| **Search** | Text injection | Hybrid semantic (local embeddings) + BM25 lexical with relevance scoring |
| **Confidence scoring** | None | 0-1 confidence per fact with source tracking |
| **Time decay** | None | 3-tier decay (30d/90d thresholds) for playbook entries |
| **Pattern reinforcement** | None | Automatic reinforcement memories on task success |
| **Mid-task correction** | Feedback-time only | Real-time regex detection during task execution (12 patterns) |
| **Privacy filtering** | Unknown | 20+ sensitive data patterns, workspace privacy modes |
| **Feedback aggregation** | None | FeedbackService with pattern counts, weekly logs, MISTAKES.md |
| **User profile learning** | None | Auto-extraction of name, preferences, location, goals from conversation |
| **Relationship memory** | None | 5-layer relationship context with commitment tracking and due dates |
| **Compression** | None | LLM-based memory compression for ~10x token efficiency |
| **Manual learning** | Skill invocation | `/learn` skill + `.cowork/MEMORY.md` persistence |
| **Agent-initiated memory** | None | `memory_save` tool for explicit mid-task persistence + `search_memories` for on-demand recall |

The ClawHub skill provides a useful starting pattern for basic learning capture. CoWork OS extends this concept into a full multi-layered learning architecture with offline search, privacy controls, and institutional knowledge management.

## Autonomous Improvement Loop

In addition to the passive learning layers above, CoWork OS now includes an autonomous improvement loop that can:

- mine recurring failures and regressions into ranked improvement candidates
- launch isolated experiments as autonomous tasks
- evaluate the result against before/after metrics
- surface review decisions and notifications
- promote successful runs by merge or GitHub PR

The current loop is intentionally more conservative than earlier versions. It is optimized for bounded, PR-first experiments instead of broad autonomous branching.

### Current operating defaults

The default settings now bias toward small, reviewable campaigns:

- `variantsPerCampaign: 1`
- `maxConcurrentImprovementExecutors: 1`
- `maxQueuedImprovementCampaigns: 1`
- `reviewRequired: false`
- `judgeRequired: false`
- `campaignTimeoutMinutes: 30`
- `campaignTokenBudget: 60000`
- `campaignCostBudget: 15`

This keeps the loop from flooding a workspace with speculative runs.

### Campaign stages

Each campaign now tracks an explicit stage:

1. `queued`
2. `preflight`
3. `reproducing`
4. `implementing`
5. `verifying`
6. `completed`

The UI surfaces these stages in the Self-Improve panel so you can tell whether a campaign is still trying to reproduce a failure, already implementing a fix, or is blocked in verification/promotion.

### Promotion gates

Promotion is stricter than “task did not fail”.

A winning run now needs:

- terminal status `ok`
- verification to pass
- no failed review signal
- evidence in the task outcome that it reproduced the issue
- evidence that verification was performed
- evidence that the result is PR-ready

If those signals are missing, the campaign is treated as non-promotable even if it produced a patch.

### Failure cooldowns and parking

Repeated failures no longer loop forever.

- provider-related failures enter a shorter cooldown
- deterministic failures enter a longer cooldown
- repeated failures with the same attempt fingerprint can park the candidate entirely
- parked candidates record `parkReason`, `parkedAt`, `lastFailureClass`, and `failureStreak`

This is important operationally because it stops the loop from repeatedly burning budget on the same broken path.

### Provider health visibility

The Self-Improve settings UI now aggregates provider-related incidents across campaigns and candidates. That lets you distinguish:

- **healthy**: no recent provider failures
- **degraded**: intermittent provider failures are present
- **blocked**: provider failures are dominating current improvement activity

This helps answer whether a campaign failed because of your codebase or because the model/provider path is unstable.

### Execution model

Each autonomous improvement run is created as a normal task with stricter agent policy:

- `source: "improvement"`
- `autonomousMode: true`
- `allowUserInput: false`
- `requireWorktree: true` by default
- `autoApproveTypes: ["run_command"]`
- verified execution and strict review settings

This keeps the loop inside the same task runtime, timeline, approvals, and notification system as the rest of the app, but with tighter isolation rules.

### Why worktrees are required

Self-improvement runs are intentionally branch-scoped. They should not edit the shared workspace directly because the loop is designed to try risky changes, validate them, and then either promote or discard them.

When `requireWorktree` is enabled:

- the task must target a real git-backed workspace
- the workspace must not be temporary
- worktree support must be enabled in settings
- `WorktreeManager.shouldUseWorktree(...)` must succeed before the run is launched

If a workspace does not satisfy those constraints, the improvement loop now skips that workspace when selecting candidates instead of launching a task that is guaranteed to fail.

### Startup ordering requirements

The autonomous loop writes normal task events, and those events may be captured by `MemoryService`. Because of that, startup ordering matters.

Correct initialization order:

1. initialize core app services
2. initialize `MemoryService`
3. start `ImprovementLoopService`

If the loop starts too early, the app may still boot successfully, but early task events can try to persist memory before `MemoryService.initialize(...)` has run. That produces a warning like:

```text
[AgentDaemon] Memory capture failed: Error: [MemoryService] Not initialized. Call MemoryService.initialize() first.
```

This was a startup-order race, not a fatal crash. The fix is to start `ImprovementLoopService` only after `MemoryService` has been initialized.

### What happened in the startup warning case

The observed startup warnings came from three separate conditions stacking together:

1. The improvement loop auto-started before memory initialization completed.
2. The top-ranked improvement candidate belonged to a workspace that could not provide git worktree isolation.
3. The daemon re-emitted a legacy alias literally named `"error"`, which triggered Node's special `EventEmitter` error behavior and produced extra log noise.

That produced this sequence:

- improvement loop starts
- autonomous improvement task is created immediately
- task requires a worktree
- workspace cannot use worktrees
- daemon records a task error
- legacy `"error"` alias emission logs `ERR_UNHANDLED_ERROR`
- event persistence attempts memory capture before memory initialization is complete

The app still finishes startup; the warnings are noisy but were not the actual startup failure.

### Current behavior after the fix

The startup and candidate-selection behavior now works like this:

- `ImprovementLoopService` starts after `MemoryService`
- when `requireWorktree` is enabled, candidate selection filters out workspaces that cannot use worktrees
- the daemon no longer re-emits a legacy `"error"` alias when nothing is listening for it
- timeline events still continue to flow normally

This means self-improvement no longer creates guaranteed-failure tasks during startup for non-git workspaces, and the earlier misleading `ERR_UNHANDLED_ERROR` noise is gone.

### Monitoring and notifications

Improvement runs can be monitored in several places:

- the task timeline for the underlying improvement task
- the Self-Improve settings/review UI
- in-app notifications
- desktop notifications

The loop emits notifications for:

- run started
- review required
- PR created
- merge succeeded
- experiment failed
- promotion failed
- review dismissed

The settings panel is also now the main operational cockpit for this loop. In addition to raw campaigns and candidates, it surfaces provider health, cooldown state, and parked-candidate context.

### Operational guidance

For the best autonomous-improvement behavior:

- keep at least one active workspace as a real git repository
- enable git worktree support for development workspaces
- use `npm run dev:log` when debugging startup or autonomous-loop behavior
- check `logs/dev-latest.log` first when diagnosing warnings or ordering issues

If you want improvement candidates to run against a specific project, make sure that project is added as a workspace and is a usable git repository from the app's perspective.
