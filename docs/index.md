features:
  - title: Personal Agentic OS
    details: CoWork OS keeps tasks, memory, skills, providers, approvals, channels, devices, and automations in one local-first governed workspace for personal AI agents.
  - title: Everything App
    details: Use one workspace for coding, web design, research, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, web pages, PDFs, email, automations, and long-running operational work.
  - title: Everything Workbench
    details: Generated documents, spreadsheets, decks, web pages, PDFs, and file outputs live beside the agent. Open artifacts in the app, edit or review them, and ask for follow-up changes with fewer switches into separate office apps.
  - title: Production Runtime
    details: Local-first runtime with approvals, guardrails, and governance controls for production agent workflows.
  - title: Linux Server Package
    details: GitHub Releases can ship a Linux x64 server tarball for VPS/systemd installs, with built daemon assets, full resources, connector runtimes, checksum verification, and a Control Plane smoke test. It runs `coworkd-node` without launching the desktop UI.
  - title: 30+ LLM Providers
    details: Connect to Claude, GPT, Gemini, Ollama, and more. Bring your own keys, switch models per task or workflow phase, and get default-on prompt caching on supported routes.
  - title: 17 Messaging Channels
    details: WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage, Teams, Google Chat, Feishu/Lark, WeCom, and more. Chat with your AI from anywhere.
  - title: Chat Mode
    details: Direct LLM chat with no tools by default, same-session follow-ups, chat-only streaming for supported providers, and a narrow read-only analysis exception for uploaded PDF turns that need deeper document reading.
  - title: Runtime Visibility
    details: Visible learning progression after each task, unified recall across tasks/messages/files, persistent shell sessions, and live provider routing/fallback status.
  - title: Structured Memory
    details: Local archive memories now have inspectable observation metadata, progressive index/timeline/detail recall tools, Memory Hub privacy controls, deterministic rebuild status, and soft-delete suppression.
  - title: Rich Artifact Previews
    details: Format-aware in-app preview popup for HTML, Markdown, code (with syntax highlighting), JSON tree view, CSV/TSV tables, XLSX, DOCX, PDF, images (fit/actual-size toggle, dimensions, alpha checkerboard), video, audio (with duration), LaTeX, and PPTX. Each format adapts the modal width, header subtitle metadata, and per-format actions; Copy path / Show in Finder / Open externally / Close are unified across every format.
  - title: Smart PDF Attachments
    details: Uploaded PDFs are copied into the workspace, summarized with page/extraction/OCR metadata and an untrusted-content boundary, then read on demand with parse_document for summaries, Q&A, extraction, comparison, and transformation. Visual PDF layout questions stay on read_pdf_visual.
  - title: Spreadsheet Artifacts
    details: Task-created spreadsheet files render as compact artifact cards. Excel workbooks and CSV/TSV open into a persisted resizable right sidebar by default; Numbers, Google Sheets shortcut, ODS, and XLSB outputs keep external-app/folder actions. Editable sheets can expand into a fullscreen spreadsheet workbench with selection, copy, zoom, add row/column, save, model picker, voice input, attachments, and follow-up task context.
  - title: Document Artifacts
    details: Task-created Word-style files render as compact artifact cards. DOCX opens directly into an editable right-sidebar document surface with Google Docs-style controls, save, copy, fullscreen mode, model picker, voice input, attachments, and follow-up task context; DOC, RTF, ODT, OTT, Pages, and related formats get best-effort preview or external-app/folder actions.
  - title: Presentation Artifacts
    details: Task-created PPTX decks render as compact artifact cards and open into a persisted resizable right-sidebar viewer with thumbnails, slide navigation, zoom, fast text-first loading, cached rendered images, speaker notes, external actions, and fullscreen follow-up context; legacy PowerPoint formats keep external-app/folder actions.
  - title: Web Page Artifacts
    details: Generated HTML/HTM files and built React output entrypoints render as compact artifact cards and open into a persisted resizable right-sidebar sandboxed iframe preview with browser/folder/copy actions and fullscreen follow-up context; React-style projects without build output show a build-output-needed state instead of auto-starting a dev server.
  - title: Browser Workbench
    details: Interactive browser-use tasks open a visible right-sidebar browser by default, with shared agent/user page state, functional navigation controls, screenshots, annotation, fullscreen follow-up context, and visible cursor movement during agent clicks, fills, reads, scrolls, and navigation.
  - title: Chronicle
    details: Opt-in desktop recent-screen context for vague on-screen references, with Memory Hub controls, local passive capture, `screen_context` recall, pause/resume, and Mission Control evidence.
  - title: Optional Supermemory
    details: Add Supermemory as an external memory lane with prompt-time profile injection, explicit external memory tools, and optional mirroring of non-private local memory captures, while keeping CoWork's local memory system primary.
  - title: Runtime Orchestration
    details: SessionRuntime owns task-session state, session checklists, visible-tool render caching, prompt-cache state, resume snapshots, and task projection while the turn kernel handles each active turn; sectioned prompts, stable-prefix prompt caching, graph-backed delegation, typed worker roles, semantic batch summaries, and terminal-state-safe resume logic keep execution, verification, and follow-up work coherent.
  - title: Managed Agents
    details: Versioned managed agents, reusable local environments, and durable managed sessions now sit on top of the existing task runtime through the control plane, while Mission Control and task surfaces observe the same backing tasks and team runs.
  - title: Composer Mentions
    details: Type `@` in the composer to pick Agents, configured Integrations, or Files. Integration chips render with icon and label in prompts and user message history, and selected integration metadata reaches the runtime as soft routing guidance rather than tool restrictions.
  - title: Message Box Shortcuts
    details: Type `/` in the composer to pick deterministic app commands and skill-backed workflow shortcuts from one menu, including `/schedule`, `/clear`, `/plan`, `/cost`, `/compact`, `/doctor`, `/undo`, direct skill IDs, plugin aliases, and the bundled CoWork Shortcuts pack.
  - title: Latest Release 0.5.43
    details: Ask Inbox sidebar workflow, richer composer integration mentions, bundled React/Next.js implementation guidance, and release artifact smoke tests for macOS DMGs, Windows installers, and Linux server tarballs.
  - title: Inbox Agent
    details: Local-first email workspace with Classic and Today modes, AI triage, Ask Inbox sidebar chat with live agentic steps and hybrid evidence retrieval, `@Inbox` main-composer routing, manual reply/reply-all/forward, editable AI drafts, commitment queues, sender cleanup, attachment indexing, and resync-safe background sync.
  - title: Managed Devices
    details: Connect local and remote CoWork nodes, inspect device summaries, browse remote workspaces, and launch tasks against selected machines from one Devices tab.
  - title: Core Automation
    details: Workflow Intelligence now forms the strict always-on core: Memory is the source of truth, Heartbeat schedules reflection, Suggestions are reviewable outputs, and Mission Control remains the cockpit.
  - title: Automations
    details: The automations surface now separates core automation from trigger ingress, device routing, schedules, webhooks, and optional twin features. Existing tasks can also become cron scheduled tasks from the task overflow menu with source task references preserved.
  - title: Heartbeat V3
    details: Default two-lane background automation with cheap Pulse checks, selective Dispatch escalation, signal compression, automation-profile ownership, and truthful Mission Control state.
  - title: 147 Built-in Skills
    details: Document creation, web research, code generation, image analysis, React/Next.js implementation guidance, and specialized bundled workflows such as `llm-wiki` for persistent research vaults, `manim-video` for technical animation, `kami` for editorial PDFs and slide decks, `react-best-practices` for React workspace changes, and `taste-skill` for high-agency frontend design. The bundled CoWork Shortcuts pack adds slash-searchable workflow aliases on top of the same skills runtime. Extensible via custom skills, ClawHub installs, external skill imports, and optional read-only external skill directories, with staged scanning and warning/quarantine handling for managed imports.
  - title: LaTeX PDF Artifacts
    details: Source-first `.tex` workflows compile with installed system TeX engines and render paired source/PDF artifact workbenches in task output surfaces.
  - title: Additive Skill Routing
    details: Skills can still be proactively shortlisted from the task, but they add context and scoped runtime directives instead of replacing the canonical user request.
  - title: Profiles & Portability
    details: Separate CoWork profiles isolate app data, credentials, channels, and sessions, with export/import flows for moving or cloning a setup safely.
  - title: Agent Teams
    details: Multi-agent collaboration with shared checklists, collaborative mode, multi-LLM synthesis, and performance reviews.
  - title: Enterprise Connectors
    details: 44 MCP connectors including Salesforce, Jira, HubSpot, Zendesk, Stripe, Tavily, Grafana, Metabase, and more, with connector notifications available to automations and configured connector mentions available from the composer.
  - title: Federated Agents
    details: Discover ACP agents, delegate to local or remote specialists, persist ACP task state locally, and invoke A2A-compatible endpoints under shared approvals and endpoint-validation rules.
  - title: Security First
    details: Local-first architecture, sandboxed execution, layered permission rules, workspace-local policy files, guardrails, approval workflows, encrypted storage, import scanning/quarantine for managed capability bundles, and a verified suite of 4,932 automated tests across 390 test files.
  - title: Best-Fit Operational Workflows
    details: Purpose-built packs for Support Ops, IT Ops, and Sales Ops — governed outcome delivery for the workflows where AI assistance has the clearest ROI. See the Best-Fit Workflows guide.
  - title: Zero-Human Company Ops
    details: Venture operator workspace kits, a dedicated Companies control surface, operator personas plus automation profiles, strategic planner issue generation, and Mission Control monitoring for founder-directed company loops.
