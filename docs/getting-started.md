# Getting Started with CoWork OS

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoWork-OS/CoWork-OS.git
cd CoWork-OS
npm run setup
```

### Step 2: Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Start the Vite dev server (React UI)
2. Launch Electron with hot reload enabled
3. Open DevTools automatically

### Step 3: Configure Your LLM Provider

1. Click the **Settings** icon (gear) in the sidebar
2. Choose your LLM provider:
   - **Anthropic** - Claude models (requires API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))
   - **Google Gemini** - Gemini models (requires API key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
   - **OpenRouter** - Multiple models (requires API key from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys))
   - **OpenAI** - GPT-4o, o1 models (requires API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
   - **AWS Bedrock** - Enterprise AWS (requires AWS credentials)
   - **Ollama** - Local models (free, requires [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed)
3. Enter your API key
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify
5. Save settings

## Troubleshooting

- If **Test Connection** fails with 401/403, verify the API key and account permissions.
- If the model list is empty, click **Refresh Models** after entering your API key (and Base URL if overridden).
- If a provider endpoint changes, override the **Base URL** in Settings (custom providers or Groq/xAI/Kimi/OpenRouter).
- If Ollama fails to connect, confirm the service is running and the base URL is correct (default `http://localhost:11434`).
- If `npm run setup` fails on macOS with `Killed: 9`, macOS terminated the native build due to memory pressure. The setup script retries automatically (with exponential backoff); if it still fails, close other apps and run `npm run setup` again.

### Step 4: Create Your First Task

1. **Select a Workspace**
   - Click "Select Folder"
   - Choose a folder you want CoWork OS to work in
   - This will be your workspace (e.g., `~/Documents/test-workspace`)

2. **Initialize the Workspace Kit (Optional, Recommended)**
   - Open **Settings** > **Memory Hub**
   - Under **Workspace Kit**, click **Initialize**
   - This creates a `.cowork/` directory in your workspace for durable context, prompt injection, and project scaffolding
   - The root kit can include shared workspace files such as `AGENTS.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `RULES.md`, `SOUL.md`, `VIBES.md`, and `LORE.md`
   - `BOOTSTRAP.md` is a one-time onboarding checklist; once you complete onboarding, removing it marks onboarding complete and CoWork OS tracks that state in `.cowork/workspace-state.json`
   - `HEARTBEAT.md` is reserved for recurring heartbeat-only checks rather than general task context
   - Project-specific context lives under `.cowork/projects/<projectId>/`, where `CONTEXT.md` captures project notes and `ACCESS.md` captures project access boundaries
   - Changes to tracked kit files keep revision snapshots under `.cowork/**/.history/`
   - You can validate kit health, freshness, and secret/missing-file warnings locally with `npm run kit:lint`

2. **Create a Task**
   - Click "+ New Task"
   - Title: "Organize my files"
   - Description: "Please organize all files in this folder by file type (Images, Documents, etc.)"
   - Click "Create Task"

3. **Watch it Work**
   - The agent will create a plan
   - Execute steps using available tools
   - Show real-time progress in the timeline
   - Request approval before destructive changes

## Orientation: Where The New Product Surfaces Live

Once the app opens, the most important places to know are:

- **Home**: quick launch plus recent sessions and recent automation activity
- **Devices**: manage the local machine and saved remote CoWork nodes, run remote tasks, and inspect remote task history
- **Settings > Automations**: Task Queue, Self-Improve, Scheduled Tasks, Webhooks, Event Triggers, and Daily Briefing
- **Settings > Companies**: company shell setup, goals, projects, issues, planner state, and linked operators
- **Mission Control**: company and operator monitoring, Kanban board, feed, and Ops view

If you are just getting started, do not configure everything at once. Set up an LLM provider, run one local task, then add Devices, Automations, or Companies as needed.

## Optional: Add A Remote Device

Use this when you want CoWork OS to run tasks on another machine, such as a Mac mini or remote workstation.

1. Start CoWork on the remote machine and enable the Control Plane.
2. Decide how you will reach it:
   - same LAN
   - SSH tunnel
   - Tailscale
3. On your main machine, open the **Devices** tab.
4. Click **Add new device**.
5. Enter the gateway URL, token, display name, and purpose.
6. Connect the device and confirm it appears in the device list.
7. Select that device and run a small test task.

After connection, you can browse remote workspaces, attach files from the remote machine, and inspect remote task history from the same Devices surface.

## Optional: Turn On Automations

Open **Settings > Automations** when you want CoWork OS to do background work without manually starting every task.

Recommended order:

1. **Task Queue**: confirm concurrency and timeout defaults.
2. **Scheduled Tasks**: add one safe recurring task.
3. **Daily Briefing**: enable a daily summary.
4. **Event Triggers / Webhooks**: connect inbound automation only after you have a stable workspace and provider setup.
5. **Self-Improve**: enable only on git-backed workspaces where worktrees are available.

## Zero-Human Company Quick Start

If you want to use CoWork OS as a founder-operated autonomous company shell:

1. Choose a real git-backed workspace.
2. Open **Settings** > **Memory Hub**.
3. Initialize **Venture operator kit**.
4. Fill in the generated `.cowork/` company files (`COMPANY.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, `KPIS.md`, `PRIORITIES.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`).
5. Open **Settings** > **Companies**.
6. Create or select the company shell you want to operate.
7. Click **Open Digital Twins** from that company.
8. Activate:
   - `Company Planner`
   - `Founder Office Operator`
9. Enable heartbeat for both operators.
10. Return to **Settings** > **Companies** and confirm the operators are linked to the intended company.
11. Open **Mission Control** from that company.
12. In the planner strip, enable scheduling, set the planner agent, and click **Run Planner**.
13. Use the `Ops` tab to monitor goals, projects, planner-managed issues, and linked execution runs.

See [Zero-Human Company Operations](zero-human-company.md) for the full architecture, recipe, use cases, and operating model.

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

The app supports hot reload:

1. **React UI Changes**: Edit files in `src/renderer/` - auto-refreshes
2. **Electron Main Changes**: Edit files in `src/electron/` - auto-restarts
3. **Shared Types**: Edit `src/shared/types.ts` - both reload

### Project Structure

```

### Debugging

**Renderer Process (UI)**:
- DevTools open automatically in dev mode
- Use `console.log()` - shows in DevTools Console

**Main Process (Backend)**:
- Use `console.log()` - shows in terminal
- Check logs:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\cowork-os\\`

### Database

SQLite database location:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/cowork-os.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\cowork-os\\cowork-os.db`

View it with any SQLite browser or:
```bash
# macOS
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/cowork-os/cowork-os.db
.tables
SELECT * FROM tasks;
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
sqlite3 "$env:APPDATA\cowork-os\cowork-os.db"
.tables
SELECT * FROM tasks;
```

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build both renderer and electron
npm run build

# Package desktop app
npm run package
```

Output: `release/*.dmg` (macOS) and `release/*.exe` (Windows)

## Common Issues

### Issue: "No LLM provider configured"

**Solution**: Open Settings (gear icon) and configure at least one LLM provider.

### Issue: Electron won't start

**Solution**: Clear and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm run setup
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" for workspace

**Solution**: Choose a folder you have write access to, like:
- `~/Documents/cowork-test`
- `~/Downloads/test`

Don't use system folders like `/System` or `/Applications`.

### Issue: Tasks fail immediately

**Solution**: Check:
1. LLM provider is configured in Settings
2. API key is valid
3. Workspace has proper permissions
4. Network connection for API calls
5. Check console for error messages

### Issue: Ollama connection failed

**Solution**:
1. Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
2. Check URL is correct (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
3. Make sure you've pulled a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Clear task descriptions work better
2. **Start Small**: Test with a few files before bulk operations
3. **Review Plans**: Check the execution plan before it runs
4. **Respond Carefully**: Read approval requests and structured input prompts before accepting or submitting
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the timeline to understand what's happening, especially when parallel tool groups collapse into summary lanes
6. **Use Local Models**: Ollama is free and works offline

## Next Steps

### Try Advanced Features

1. **Web Search**: Configure a search provider and ask research questions
2. **Browser Automation**: Have the agent navigate websites and extract data
3. **Remote Access**: Set up WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Slack bot for mobile/remote access
4. **Document Creation**: Create professional Excel, Word, PDF, or PowerPoint files
5. **Goal Mode**: Define success criteria and let the agent auto-retry until verification passes
6. **Custom Skills**: Create reusable workflows with custom prompts in Settings > Custom Skills
7. **MCP Servers**: Connect to external tools via MCP in Settings > MCP Servers
8. **Enterprise Connectors**: Install Salesforce, Jira, HubSpot, and other connectors from the MCP Registry
9. **Cloud Storage**: Connect Notion, Box, OneDrive, Google Workspace (Gmail/Calendar/Drive), Dropbox, or SharePoint — click their cards in Settings > Integrations
10. **Parallel Tasks**: Run multiple tasks concurrently (configure in Settings > Task Queue)
11. **Guardrails**: Set token/cost budgets and blocked commands in Settings > Guardrails
