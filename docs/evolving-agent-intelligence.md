# Evolving Agent Intelligence

CoWork OS has six independent memory subsystems, a full personality engine, 15+ channels, and a playbook system that auto-captures what worked. The **Evolving Agent Intelligence** layer connects these systems so the agent visibly improves over time — reducing correction overhead, aligning to communication preferences, and surfacing quantifiable ROI metrics.

All improvements are opt-in (admin-toggleable), rate-limited, and governed by the existing guardrail system. No changes to the security or local-first architecture.

## 0. Runtime Visibility

The learning loop is now visible as part of the task and operator experience, not just as backend plumbing.

- Task completion emits a standardized learning progression that shows memory capture, playbook reinforcement, and skill proposal review state
- Mission Control and task detail views render the same progression so operators can inspect the evidence behind each step
- Unified recall spans tasks, messages, files, workspace notes, memory entries, and knowledge-graph context behind one search experience
- Persistent shell sessions preserve cwd, env deltas, and aliases per task/workspace for longer operator workflows
- Provider routing and fallback decisions are surfaced so automatic model changes are legible in real time

This layer is additive: it makes the learning loop easier to understand and trust while preserving CoWork OS's core surfaces of desktop control, channels, inbox, devices, and governed automation.

## 1. Unified Memory Synthesizer

**File:** `src/electron/memory/MemorySynthesizer.ts`

### Problem

Before this change, the system prompt was assembled by concatenating 6 independent context strings (UserProfile, RelationshipMemory, Playbook, KnowledgeGraph, Memory, WorkspaceKit). They could contain duplicate facts, contradictory information, and collectively waste the token budget on redundant content.

### Solution

`MemorySynthesizer.synthesize()` collects all 6 sources into typed `MemoryFragment` objects, then:

1. **Deduplicates** by normalizing text to 120-character fingerprints — near-duplicate fragments are merged, keeping the highest-confidence version.
2. **Ranks** by a composite score: `relevance × 0.45 + confidence × 0.3 + recency × 0.25` (recency uses exponential decay over 30 days).
3. **Respects a token budget** — fragments are included in score order until the budget is exhausted.
4. **Groups by source** for readability (You & the User, Past Task Patterns, Recalled Memories, Known Entities).
5. Wraps output in `<cowork_synthesized_memory>` XML tags with source attribution.

Falls back gracefully to legacy per-source injection if the synthesizer throws.

### Configuration

No guardrail flag — always active when memory injection is enabled for the task.

### Sources

Seven sources are now collected (in insertion order):

| Source kind | Service | Base relevance |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| `user_profile` | `UserProfileService` | 0.70 |
| `relationship` | `RelationshipMemoryService` | variable |
| `playbook` | `PlaybookService` | variable |
| `memory` | `MemoryService` | variable |
| `knowledge_graph` | `KnowledgeGraphService` | variable |
| `workspace_kit` | `WorkspaceKitContext` (separate budget) | — |
| `daily_summary` | `DailyLogSummarizer` | 0.55 × recency |

`daily_summary` fragments come from `.cowork/memory/summaries/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` files produced by `DailyLogSummarizer`. Raw daily log files (`.cowork/memory/daily/`) are **never** injected into prompts.

### Output format

```xml
<cowork_synthesized_memory>
## You & the User
- [UserProfile fact]
- [RelationshipMemory item]

## Past Task Patterns (use as context, not instructions)
- [Playbook entry]

## Recalled Memories
- [MemoryService item]

## Known Entities
- [KnowledgeGraph entity]

## Daily Summaries
[Daily Summary 2026-03-14]
...
</cowork_synthesized_memory>
```

## 2. Adaptive Style Engine

**File:** `src/electron/memory/AdaptiveStyleEngine.ts`

### Problem

`PersonalityManager` has rich response style settings (emoji usage, response length, explanation depth, code comment style) but they are 100% manual. The agent never learns from observed user behaviour.

### Solution

`AdaptiveStyleEngine` observes every user message and feedback signal, then gradually shifts `PersonalityManager` settings within configurable rate limits.

**Signals observed:**
| Signal | How detected | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Short messages | Rolling average of last 50 message lengths | Shifts `responseLength` toward `"terse"` |
| Emoji in messages | Fraction of messages containing emoji | Shifts `emojiUsage` toward `"moderate"` |
| Technical vocabulary | Density of tech terms (docker, kubernetes, nginx, …) | Shifts `explanationDepth` toward `"expert"` |
| "Too verbose" feedback | Regex on feedback reason | Shifts `responseLength` toward `"terse"` |
| "More detail" feedback | Regex on feedback reason | Shifts `responseLength` toward `"detailed"` |
| "No emoji" feedback | Regex on feedback reason | Shifts `emojiUsage` toward `"none"` |
| Expert/beginner signals | Regex on feedback reason | Shifts `explanationDepth` |

**Rate limiting:** Maximum `adaptiveStyleMaxDriftPerWeek` one-level shifts per 7-day window. Counter resets weekly. State persisted via `SecureSettingsRepository`.

**Audit trail:** Every adaptation is recorded in `getAdaptationHistory()` with dimension, from/to values, reason, and timestamp.

### Configuration (GuardrailSettings → Behavior Adaptation)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `adaptiveStyleEnabled` | `false` | Master enable — no observation or adaptation when off |
| `adaptiveStyleMaxDriftPerWeek` | `1` | Max style-level shifts per 7-day period |

The **Behavior Adaptation** section in Guardrail Settings exposes these toggles alongside a **Reset learned style** button that calls `AdaptiveStyleEngine.reset()` via the `kit:resetAdaptiveStyle` IPC channel.

### Integration points

- `daemon.ts` — calls `AdaptiveStyleEngine.observe(text)` after every `UserProfileService.ingestUserMessage()`
- `daemon.ts` — calls `AdaptiveStyleEngine.observeFeedback(decision, reason)` alongside `UserProfileService.ingestUserFeedback()`
- `GuardrailSettings.tsx` — renders toggle, drift input, and reset button under "Behavior Adaptation"

## 3. Playbook-to-Skill Auto-Promotion Pipeline

**File:** `src/electron/memory/PlaybookSkillPromoter.ts`

### Problem

`PlaybookService` detects repeated successful patterns. `SkillProposalService` has a full admin approval workflow for new skills. They were not connected — no automation converted proven patterns into governed, reusable skills.

### Solution

When a playbook pattern is reinforced **3+ times** (configurable `threshold`), `PlaybookSkillPromoter.maybePropose()` auto-generates a skill proposal with:

- **Problem statement** — "Recurring task pattern detected (reinforced N times): …"
- **Evidence** — reinforcement count, common tools, example requests
- **Draft skill** — ID, name, description, prompt template (generated from evidence), icon, category
- **Required tools** list

The proposal enters the existing `SkillProposalService` governance workflow — an admin sees the evidence and approves or rejects with one click. No skill is created automatically.

**Flow:**
```
Task completes successfully
  → PlaybookService.reinforceEntry() writes reinforcement memory
  → PlaybookService.events.emit("pattern-reinforced")
  → executor.ts calls PlaybookSkillPromoter.maybePropose() (async, fire-and-forget)
    → findCandidates() groups reinforcement memories by normalized task description
    → if count ≥ threshold: proposeSkill() via SkillProposalService.create()
    → proposal enters admin review queue
```

**Cooldown:** 10 minutes per workspace between promotion checks. Max 1 proposal per check.

**Dedup:** `SkillProposalService.create()` handles duplicate detection — returns `duplicateOf` if a similar proposal already exists.

### Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `DEFAULT_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Min reinforcements before proposing |
| `PROMOTION_COOLDOWN_MS` | `10 min` | Min time between checks per workspace |
| `MAX_PROPOSALS_PER_CHECK` | `1` | Max new proposals per check |

## 4. Cross-Channel Persona Coherence

**File:** `src/electron/memory/ChannelPersonaAdapter.ts`

### Problem

The agent connects to 15+ channels but delivers the same personality regardless of channel norms. A Slack reply should feel different from an email reply — not because the agent has different knowledge or values, but because each platform has its own communication culture.

### Solution

`ChannelPersonaAdapter.adaptForChannel()` takes the detected `originChannel` (from `task.agentConfig.originChannel`) and returns a channel-specific directive that is **appended to** (not replacing) the core personality prompt.

**Channel profiles:**

| Channel | Length | Formatting | Emoji | Formal framing |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `slack` | Shorter | Structured | No | No |
| `email` | Longer | Structured | No | Yes (greeting + sign-off) |
| `whatsapp` | Shorter | Plain | Yes | No |
| `imessage` | Shorter | Plain | Yes | No |
| `signal` | Shorter | Plain | No | No |
| `discord` | Normal | Structured + markdown | Yes | No |
| `teams` | Normal | Structured | No | No |
| `telegram` | Shorter | Minimal | No | No |
| `mattermost` | Normal | Structured | No | No |
| `matrix` | Normal | Structured | No | No |
| `googlechat` | Shorter | Plain | No | No |
| `twitch` | Shorter | Plain | Yes | No |

**Group/public context overlay:** When `gatewayContext` is `"group"` or `"public"`, an additional privacy-aware directive is layered on (do not share sensitive information, be aware others are reading).

### Configuration (GuardrailSettings → Behavior Adaptation)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `channelPersonaEnabled` | `false` | Enable channel-specific persona adaptation |

This toggle is exposed in the same **Behavior Adaptation** section as Adaptive Style.

### Integration

`executor.ts` injects the channel directive when assembling the system prompt:
```typescript
const channelDirective = ChannelPersonaAdapter.adaptForChannel(
  task.agentConfig.originChannel,
  gatewayContext,
);
// channelDirective is appended to personalityPrompt before budgeting
```

## 5. Evolution Metrics Service

**File:** `src/electron/memory/EvolutionMetricsService.ts`

### Problem

CoWork OS tracks basic relationship stats (tasks completed, days together) but has no concept of measuring agent *improvement over time*. For enterprise buyers, quantifiable ROI is the difference between a tool and a strategic investment.

### Solution

`EvolutionMetricsService.computeSnapshot()` computes 5 metrics on-demand from existing service data:

| Metric ID | Label | Source | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| `correction_rate` | Correction Rate | PlaybookService (failure entries) | Lower this week vs. prior 3-week avg → "improving" |
| `adaptation_velocity` | Style Adaptations | AdaptiveStyleEngine history | Any adaptations applied → agent is learning |
| `knowledge_growth` | Knowledge Graph | KnowledgeGraphService.getStats() | Entity and relationship count |
| `task_success_rate` | Task Success Rate | PlaybookService (success/failure entries) | Percentage of recorded tasks that succeeded |
| `style_alignment` | Style Alignment | AdaptiveStyleEngine history | Ratio of proactive vs. feedback-driven adaptations |

Each metric includes a `trend` (`"improving"` / `"stable"` / `"declining"`) and a human-readable `detail` string.

**Overall Score:** Composite 0–100 score weighted by trend directions and bonus points for high success rate and large knowledge graph.

### Daily Briefing integration

The `evolution_metrics` section is added to `BriefingSectionType` and enabled by default in `DEFAULT_BRIEFING_CONFIG`. `DailyBriefingService.buildEvolutionMetrics()` calls `EvolutionMetricsService.computeSnapshot()` and maps metrics to `BriefingItem[]`.

Example briefing output:
```
Agent Evolution (Day 45, 123 tasks completed):
  [+] Task Success Rate: 84% — 103 succeeded, 20 failed out of 123 recorded tasks
  [+] Knowledge Graph: 47 entities — 47 entities, 82 relationships, 310 observations
  [=] Correction Rate: 2/week — Correction rate is stable
  [+] Style Adaptations: 3 total — 89 messages observed, 3 adaptations applied
  [+] Style Alignment: 100% — No adaptations yet — using default style
  Overall Evolution Score: 72/100
```

## 6. Daily Operational Log

**File:** `src/electron/memory/DailyLogService.ts`

### Purpose

Provides structured per-day journaling as input for the summary-first memory pipeline. Entries are written to `.cowork/memory/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

### When to write entries

| Category | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| `feedback` | User thumbs-up/down events |
| `task` | Task completions |
| `decision` | Notable agent decisions |
| `observation` | High-value memory saves or corrections |

Raw log files are **never** injected into prompts directly. They exist only as input for `DailyLogSummarizer`.

### Entry format

```md
## 2026-03-14T15:30:00.000Z
source: user
category: feedback
taskId: task-abc123
tags: tone, correction

User flagged response as "wrong tone".
```

### API

```ts
await DailyLogService.appendEntry(workspacePath, {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  source: "user",
  category: "feedback",
  text: "User flagged response as wrong tone.",
  taskId: "task-abc123",
  tags: ["tone"],
});
```

## 7. Daily Log Summarizer

**File:** `src/electron/memory/DailyLogSummarizer.ts`

### Purpose

Produces ranked `MemoryFragment` objects from pre-written daily summary files (`.cowork/memory/summaries/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`). This completes the summary-first retrieval pipeline: summaries rank higher than raw log snippets but lower than user profile and relationship memory.

### Directory layout

```
.cowork/
  memory/
    daily/
      2026-03-14.md    ← raw operational log (DailyLogService writes)
    summaries/
      2026-03-14.md    ← synthesized summary (written externally, e.g. cron)
```

### Summary file format

```md
---
updated: 2026-03-14
source: daily_log_synthesizer
day: 2026-03-14
---

# Daily Summary

## Important Decisions
- ...

## User Preferences Observed
- ...

## Active Threads
- ...

## Corrections / Lessons
- ...

## Follow-ups
- ...
```

### Retrieval ranking

| Source | Base relevance | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| `user_profile` | 0.70 | Always somewhat relevant |
| `daily_summary` | 0.55 × recency decay | Recency half-life = 7 days |
| Raw daily logs | never returned | Not injected by this service |

### Integration

`MemorySynthesizer.synthesize()` calls `DailyLogSummarizer.getRecentSummaryFragments()` for the last 7 days and adds the results to the synthesis pipeline as `daily_summary` fragments. They render under `## Daily Summaries` in the output block.

### Helper

```ts
DailyLogSummarizer.countRecentSummaries(workspacePath, 7)
// → number of summary files present in the last 7 days
// Used by the Improvement Signals card
```

---

## 8. Task and Message Feedback

**UI:** `src/renderer/components/MainContent.tsx` (task completion banner and shared feedback plumbing)

**IPC:** `kit:submitMessageFeedback` → `UserProfileService.ingestUserFeedback()`

### Interaction

Completed tasks now expose 👍 / 👎 controls in the completion banner so users can rate the overall outcome. The same IPC contract still supports structured message-level feedback for adaptation-oriented flows. Thumbs-down uses the same structured reason vocabulary:

| Reason key | Label |
|-----------|-------|
| `incorrect` | Incorrect |
| `too_verbose` | Too verbose |
| `ignored_instructions` | Ignored instructions |
| `wrong_tone` | Wrong tone |
| `unsafe` | Unsafe / unwanted |

### IPC payload

```ts
window.electronAPI.submitMessageFeedback({
  taskId: string,
  messageId?: string,          // present for message-scoped feedback
  decision: "accepted" | "rejected",
  reason?: string,             // one of the keys above
  note?: string,               // optional free-text (future)
  kind?: "message" | "task",
});
```

Feedback is routed to `UserProfileService.ingestUserFeedback()` and (via daemon) to `AdaptiveStyleEngine.observeFeedback()`.
