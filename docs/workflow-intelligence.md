# Workflow Intelligence

Workflow Intelligence is the user-facing concept for CoWork OS's always-on learning and next-action system.

It replaces the older product framing around `Subconscious` with a clearer model:

- `Memory` is the source of truth.
- `Heartbeat` owns scheduling and signal readiness.
- `Reflection` is the internal evaluation phase.
- `Dreaming` is the background memory-curation phase.
- `Suggestions` are the default user-facing output.

The goal is not opaque background autonomy. The goal is reviewable help that gets better from how the user responds.

## What Changed

The previous model exposed too much of the reflective internals. It also let the reflective layer behave like a parallel memory product and a separate scheduler.

The new model makes the boundaries explicit:

| Layer | Responsibility | User-facing? |
|---|---|---|
| `Memory` | Stores durable preferences, workflow patterns, corrections, open loops, recurring tasks, and ignored-noise signals | Yes, through Memory Hub and retrieved context |
| `Heartbeat` | Decides when enough fresh signal exists to think again | Mostly visible through Mission Control status |
| `Reflection` | Evaluates evidence, generates hypotheses, critiques them, and chooses a recommended next action | No, except in diagnostics/settings |
| `Dreaming` | Reviews recent sessions, memory observations, corrections, and drift signals to propose memory updates | Yes, through reviewable memory candidates |
| `Suggestions` | Presents reviewable next actions with evidence, confidence, and controls | Yes |

`Subconscious` remains an internal compatibility name in some code paths, database tables, artifact folders, and logs. Product copy and docs should use `Workflow Intelligence` unless they are describing those internals directly.

`Dreaming` is the new name for the memory-curation phase inside this loop. It should not be described as a generic reflective loop or as a second memory system.

## Operating Loop

Workflow Intelligence runs as a closed feedback loop:

```text
workspace activity, memory, mailbox, tasks, git, schedules, triggers
    -> Heartbeat signal ledger
    -> Heartbeat Pulse decides whether reflection is useful now
    -> Reflection collects evidence, critiques options, and selects a recommendation
    -> Dreaming curates recent memory/session evidence into reviewable candidates when drift signals justify it
    -> Memory receives candidates and durable feedback signals
    -> Suggestions show reviewable next actions
    -> user acts, edits, snoozes, dismisses, or ignores
    -> feedback updates memory and future suggestion scoring
```

This keeps learning grounded in observable user behavior rather than hidden assumptions.

## Suggestion Contract

Every user-facing suggestion should carry enough context to be trusted or rejected quickly:

- **Title**: the proposed work in plain language
- **Why now**: the timing reason
- **Source evidence**: recent signals or modules that led to the suggestion
- **Confidence**: a lightweight score for ranking and triage
- **Suggested action**: the prompt/action CoWork can start from
- **Controls**: act, edit, snooze, dismiss

The welcome screen shows these as **Next actions** under the message box. The same suggestion objects can also appear in the automation inbox and Suggestions panel.

## Learning From Response

User response is now part of the learning model:

| Response | Learning effect |
|---|---|
| `Act` | Reinforces the suggestion class/source as useful and captures a workflow-pattern memory |
| `Edit` | Captures a correction memory with the original and edited action |
| `Snooze` | Hides the suggestion until the snooze time and slightly lowers similar timing/source patterns |
| `Dismiss` | Captures ignored-noise feedback and lowers similar future suggestions |
| `Ignore` | If a surfaced suggestion sits stale long enough, it becomes weak ignored-noise feedback |

This is the missing loop that turns suggestions from a static list into a system that adapts to the user's workflow.

## Memory As Source Of Truth

Reflection no longer treats its local memory index as the main learning product.

Reflection outputs are converted into core memory candidates, including:

- user preference
- workflow pattern
- open loop
- correction
- recurring task
- ignored noise
- watch item
- constraint

Accepted candidates flow through the core memory distillation path. This keeps durable learning in the existing memory stack instead of creating a parallel source of truth.

## Dreaming As Memory Curation

Dreaming is the offline memory-maintenance lane. It runs after meaningful task completion and can also be triggered by Heartbeat when `memory_drift`, `correction_learning`, or `cross_workspace_patterns` signals appear.

Dreaming reads bounded evidence from session checkpoints, transcript spans, structured memory observations, and curated hot memory. It writes `dreaming_runs` and `dreaming_candidates`, not final memory mutations. Candidates remain reviewable by default and can propose curated-memory adds/replacements/archives, stale archive flags, topic-pack refreshes, ignored-noise patterns, open loops, recurring tasks, constraints, or corrections.

This keeps Dreaming useful without making it a second memory system: accepted candidates still flow through existing Memory, Curated Memory, topic-pack, or Core Harness paths.

See [Dreaming](dreaming.md) for the canonical memory-curation contract.

## Heartbeat As Scheduler

Heartbeat owns the "when should we think?" decision.

Heartbeat can trigger reflection when signals justify it, for example:

- non-idle Pulse outcome
- multiple actionable signals
- several relevant recent activities
- assigned work that may need follow-up
- due checklist or proactive items

Reflection no longer runs its own independent interval loop. It can still be run manually from settings for inspection/debugging.

## Review Before Autonomy

Workflow Intelligence defaults to reviewable suggestions.

Auto-created tasks are allowed only when all of these are true:

- auto-create is explicitly enabled
- the recommendation is low risk
- the target scope is clear
- policy allows the executor
- either the target is trusted or similar suggestions were repeatedly accepted

This keeps CoWork useful before it becomes autonomous and avoids surprising task creation from weak signals.

## Product Surfaces

Workflow Intelligence appears in:

- **Welcome screen**: `Next actions` under the message box
- **Home dashboard**: automation inbox items and recent automation activity
- **Settings > Automations > Workflow Intelligence**: policy, target, run, and diagnostic controls
- **Suggestions panel**: review, act, snooze, and dismiss active suggestions
- **Mission Control**: heartbeat state, traces, core harness learning, and dispatched work
- **Memory Hub**: durable memories, Dreaming candidates, and candidate learning created from accepted/corrected/ignored patterns

Reflection internals remain inspectable for power users, but suggestions are the primary user-facing output.

## Durable State And Compatibility

Current implementation details still use legacy names in some places:

- `.cowork/subconscious/` artifact folders
- `SubconsciousLoopService` logs
- `subconscious_*` SQLite tables
- IPC names such as `runSubconsciousNow`

Those names are compatibility details. New documentation, labels, and product copy should use `Workflow Intelligence`.

The artifact contract remains useful for debugging:

```text
.cowork/subconscious/
  brain/state.json
  brain/dreams/*.json
  journal/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
  targets/<targetKey>/state.json
  targets/<targetKey>/backlog.md
  targets/<targetKey>/runs/<runId>/evidence.json
  targets/<targetKey>/runs/<runId>/ideas.jsonl
  targets/<targetKey>/runs/<runId>/critique.jsonl
  targets/<targetKey>/runs/<runId>/decision.json
  targets/<targetKey>/runs/<runId>/winning-recommendation.md
  targets/<targetKey>/runs/<runId>/dispatch.json
```

SQLite remains the fast index/query layer. Memory remains the durable learning source of truth.

## Relation To Core Harness

Workflow Intelligence feeds and consumes the core harness:

- Heartbeat and reflection create core traces.
- Traces produce memory candidates.
- Failures can become clusters and eval cases.
- Accepted memory candidates improve later retrieval and suggestion scoring.
- User response feedback tunes future suggestion ranking.

The core harness is the measurable improvement system. Workflow Intelligence is the product loop that turns that learning into reviewable work.
