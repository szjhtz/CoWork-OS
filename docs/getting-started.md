# Getting Started with CoWork OS

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoWork-OS/CoWork-OS.git
cd CoWork-OS
npm run setup
```

### Step 2: Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Start the Vite dev server (React UI)
2. Launch Electron with hot reload enabled
3. Open DevTools automatically

### Step 3: Configure Your LLM Provider

1. Click the **Settings** icon (gear) in the sidebar
2. Choose your LLM provider:
   - **Claude** - Claude API key or Claude subscription token
   - **Google Gemini** - Gemini models (requires API key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))
   - **OpenRouter** - Multiple models (requires API key from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys))
   - **OpenAI** - GPT-4o, o1 models (requires API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
   - **AWS Bedrock** - Enterprise AWS (requires AWS credentials)
   - **Ollama** - Local models (free, requires [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed)
3. If you choose **Claude**, pick one of these tabs:
   - **Claude API**: paste an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - **Claude Subscription**: install the provider's terminal app, run its token setup flow, and paste the generated `sk-ant-oat...` token
4. Click **Refresh Models** to load the live models available to your credential, then choose a model
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify
6. Save settings

### Optional: Configure Fallback Chains

After your primary provider works, open:

- **Settings > LLM** to set ordered fallback providers/models
- **Settings > Web Search** to set primary and fallback search providers such as Tavily, Exa, Brave, SerpAPI, or Google

CoWork OS uses those ordered chains when a provider is unavailable, rate-limited, or lacks the needed capability for a task.

For LLM providers, retryable failures such as `429` rate limits immediately advance to the next configured fallback provider/model. In **Settings > LLM > Provider Failover**, `Retry primary after (seconds)` controls when CoWork OS should probe the primary route again after failover:

- blank uses the default 60-second cooldown
- `0` retries the primary on the next route refresh
- higher values keep the working fallback route active longer before retrying the primary

### Optional: Configure Memory Hub And Supermemory

Before you start relying on long-term context, open **Settings > Memory Hub** and confirm how memory should behave for this profile.

- **Workspace Kit** initializes the local `.cowork/` context files used for durable prompt injection and project guidance.
- **Memory settings** control local capture, privacy mode, retention, and preview of the `L0/L1` memory payload.
- **Supermemory** is optional. If you want an external memory provider, enable it here, paste your API key, keep the default `cowork:{workspaceId}` container template unless you need something else, save, and click **Test Connection**.

Supermemory does not replace CoWork's local memory system. It adds an external profile/search layer, explicit `supermemory_*` tools, optional prompt-time profile injection, and optional mirroring of non-private local memory captures. See [Supermemory Integration](supermemory.md).

## Troubleshooting

- If **Test Connection** fails with 401/403, verify the API key or token and the account permissions behind it.
- If the Claude model list is empty, click **Refresh Models** after entering your API key or Claude subscription token.
- If a provider endpoint changes, override the **Base URL** in Settings (custom providers or Groq/xAI/Kimi/OpenRouter).
- If Ollama fails to connect, confirm the service is running and the base URL is correct (default `http://localhost:11434`).
- If `npm run setup` fails on macOS with `Killed: 9`, macOS terminated the native build due to memory pressure. The setup script retries automatically (with exponential backoff); if it still fails, close other apps and run `npm run setup` again.
- Note: as of April 4, 2026, third-party harnesses connected to your Claude account draw from extra usage instead of from your subscription. If you do not use them, nothing changes. If you do, the credit and bundles above have you covered.

### Step 4: Create Your First Task

1. **Select a Workspace**
   - Click "Select Folder"
   - Choose a folder you want CoWork OS to work in
   - This will be your workspace (e.g., `~/Documents/test-workspace`)

2. **Initialize the Workspace Kit (Optional, Recommended)**
   - Open **Settings** > **Memory Hub**
   - Under **Workspace Kit**, click **Initialize**
   - This creates a `.cowork/` directory in your workspace for durable context, prompt injection, and project scaffolding
   - The root kit can include shared workspace files such as `AGENTS.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `RULES.md`, `SOUL.md`, `VIBES.md`, and `LORE.md`
   - `BOOTSTRAP.md` is a one-time onboarding checklist; once you complete onboarding, removing it marks onboarding complete and CoWork OS tracks that state in `.cowork/workspace-state.json`
   - `HEARTBEAT.md` is reserved for recurring heartbeat-only checks rather than general task context
   - Project-specific context lives under `.cowork/projects/<projectId>/`, where `CONTEXT.md` captures project notes and `ACCESS.md` captures project access boundaries
   - Changes to tracked kit files keep revision snapshots under `.cowork/**/.history/`
   - You can validate kit health, freshness, and secret/missing-file warnings locally with `npm run kit:lint`

2. **Create a Task**
   - Click "+ New Task"
   - Title: "Organize my files"
   - Description: "Please organize all files in this folder by file type (Images, Documents, etc.)"
   - Click "Create Task"

3. **Watch it Work**
   - The agent will create a plan
   - Execute steps using available tools
   - Show real-time progress in the timeline
   - Request approval before destructive changes

## Orientation: Where The New Product Surfaces Live

Once the app opens, the most important places to know are:

- **Home**: quick launch plus recent sessions and recent automation activity
- **Devices**: manage the local machine and saved remote CoWork nodes, run remote tasks, and inspect remote task history
- **Settings > Automations**: Task Queue, Subconscious, Scheduled Tasks, Webhooks, Event Triggers, and Daily Briefing
- **Settings > Profiles**: create, switch, export, and import isolated app profiles
- **Settings > Companies**: company shell setup, goals, projects, issues, planner state, and linked operators
- **Mission Control**: company and operator monitoring, Kanban board, feed, and Ops view
- **Settings > Skills**: Skill Store imports plus optional external read-only skill directories
- **Settings > Channels**: Slack multi-workspace setup, Telegram group routing, Discord guild allowlists, and enterprise channels such as Feishu/Lark and WeCom
- **Settings → Tools → Computer use** (macOS): Accessibility + Screen Recording onboarding, built-in tool toggles, and context for [desktop automation](computer-use.md)
- **Settings → Memory Hub → Chronicle**: primary Chronicle setup for consent-gated recent-screen context, pause/resume, capture scope, OCR status, and linked memory behavior. The dedicated `chronicle` tool category still lives in **Settings → Tools → Built-in tools**. See [Chronicle](chronicle.md).

If you are just getting started, do not configure everything at once. Set up an LLM provider, run one local task, then add Devices, Automations, or Companies as needed.

## Optional: Try Chronicle

Use this if you want CoWork OS to understand vague on-screen references from the desktop app.

1. Open **Settings > Memory Hub > Chronicle**.
2. Turn on **Chronicle (Research Preview)** and accept the consent prompt.
3. Grant **Screen Recording** for CoWork OS if macOS prompts for it.
4. Optional but useful: grant **Accessibility** so Chronicle can attach better frontmost app/window metadata.
5. Confirm **Settings > Tools > Built-in tools** still has **Chronicle** enabled.
6. Restart the app if you changed Screen Recording.
7. Put a window with distinctive visible text on screen for 15-30 seconds.
8. Start a fresh task with the per-task **Chronicle ON** toggle left enabled and ask:

```text
Use screen_context_resolve now. Tell me what app and window are on screen and what text is visible on the right side.
```

Once that works, try vaguer prompts such as `what is this on screen` or `why is this failing`. You can later pause Chronicle from the Chronicle settings card or the tray menu instead of turning it off entirely.

See [Chronicle](chronicle.md) for the full guide and [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#chronicle-desktop-screen-context-issues) if it does not trigger.

## Optional: Add A Remote Device

Use this when you want CoWork OS to run tasks on another machine, such as a Mac mini or remote workstation.

1. Start CoWork on the remote machine and enable the Control Plane.
2. Decide how you will reach it:
   - same LAN
   - SSH tunnel
   - Tailscale
3. On your main machine, open the **Devices** tab.
4. Click **Add new device**.
5. Enter the gateway URL, token, display name, and purpose.
6. Connect the device and confirm it appears in the device list.
7. Select that device and run a small test task.

After connection, you can browse remote workspaces, attach files from the remote machine, and inspect remote task history from the same Devices surface.

## Optional: Set Up Profiles

Use profiles when you want separate CoWork environments for personal work, clients, staging, or isolated channel credentials.

Typical profile workflow:

1. Open **Settings > Profiles**.
2. Create a new profile or duplicate your current one.
3. Switch into that profile before configuring channels, providers, or skills.
4. Use **Export Profile** to create a transferable profile bundle.
5. Use **Import Profile** on another machine or install to restore the same setup, with optional rename on import.

Each profile keeps its own local database, encrypted settings, managed skills, channel configs, and session history.

## Optional: Turn On Automations

Open **Settings > Automations** when you want CoWork OS to do background work without manually starting every task.

Recommended order:

1. **Task Queue**: confirm concurrency and timeout defaults.
2. **Routines**: create one safe routine with a manual or schedule trigger.
3. **Daily Briefing**: enable a daily summary if you want background context generation.
4. **Webhooks / Event Triggers**: connect inbound automation only after you have a stable workspace and provider setup, and only when you need the lower-level surfaces directly.
5. **Subconscious**: enable the reflective loop once you have at least one stable workflow target. Code-change dispatch works best on git-backed workspaces where worktrees are available.

Rule of thumb:

- use `Routines` for saved automation with policy, outputs, and run history
- use `Scheduled Tasks`, `Webhooks`, or `Event Triggers` directly only when you specifically need the advanced underlying engine

## Zero-Human Company Quick Start

If you want to use CoWork OS as a founder-operated autonomous company shell:

1. Choose a real git-backed workspace.
2. Open **Settings** > **Memory Hub**.
3. Initialize **Venture operator kit**.
4. Fill in the generated `.cowork/` company files (`COMPANY.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, `KPIS.md`, `PRIORITIES.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`).
5. Open **Settings** > **Companies**.
6. Create or select the company shell you want to operate.
7. Click **Open Digital Twins** from that company.
8. Activate:
   - `Company Planner`
   - `Founder Office Operator`
9. Enable heartbeat for both operators.
10. Return to **Settings** > **Companies** and confirm the operators are linked to the intended company.
11. Open **Mission Control** from that company.
12. In the planner strip, enable scheduling, set the planner agent, and click **Run Planner**.
13. Use the `Ops` tab to monitor goals, projects, planner-managed issues, and linked execution runs.

See [Zero-Human Company Operations](zero-human-company.md) for the full architecture, recipe, use cases, and operating model.

## Example Tasks to Try

### 1. File Organization

```
Title: Organize Downloads
Description: Organize all files in this folder by type. Create folders for Images, Documents, Spreadsheets, and Other. Move files into appropriate folders.
```

### 2. Create a Spreadsheet

```
Title: Create sales report
Description: Create an Excel spreadsheet with monthly sales data for Q1-Q4. Include columns for Month, Revenue, Expenses, and Profit. Add a summary row with totals.
```

### 3. Create a Document

```
Title: Write project summary
Description: Create a Word document summarizing our project. Include sections for Overview, Goals, Timeline, and Next Steps. Use professional formatting.

### 4. Create a Presentation

```
Title: Create quarterly report
Description: Create a PowerPoint presentation with 5 slides covering Q1 2024 highlights. Include: Title slide, Overview, Key Metrics, Challenges, and Next Steps.
```

When the task completes, the `.pptx` appears as a normal task artifact. Click the inline deck card or open the file from **Files** to inspect slides in CoWork with thumbnails, slide navigation, extracted speaker notes, and best-effort rendered slide images. If local rendering tools are missing, the viewer still shows extracted slide text and notes.

### 5. Web Research (works out of the box; optional paid providers for richer results)

```
Title: Research AI trends
Description: Search the web for the latest trends in AI for 2024 and create a summary document with the top 5 findings.
```

- Shell commands

You'll see a dialog with:
- What it wants to do
- Why it needs to do it
- Approve or Deny buttons

## Configuring Providers

### LLM Providers

Open **Settings** > **LLM**:

| Provider | Setup |
|----------|-------|
| Claude | Use **Claude API** with a key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com), or use **Claude Subscription** with a token from `claude setup-token` |
| Google Gemini | Enter API key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| OpenRouter | Enter API key from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys) |
| OpenAI (API Key) | Enter API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| OpenAI (ChatGPT) | Click "Sign in with ChatGPT" to use your subscription |
| AWS Bedrock | Enter AWS Access Key, Secret Key, and Region |
| Ollama | Install Ollama, pull a model, select it |
| Groq | Enter API key in Settings |
| xAI (Grok) | Enter API key in Settings |
| Kimi (Moonshot) | Enter API key in Settings |

Prompt caching is enabled by default on supported Anthropic and GPT-style routes. CoWork automatically keeps stable session prompt sections cacheable and dynamic turn context uncached, so follow-ups can reuse the provider-side prefix without caching the clock, recall, or one-off guidance.

### Compatible / Gateway Providers

Configure these in **Settings** > **LLM Provider** by entering API keys/tokens, model IDs, and base URLs when required.

| Provider | Setup |
|----------|-------|
| OpenCode Zen | API key + base URL in Settings |
| Google Vertex | Access token + base URL in Settings |
| Google Antigravity | Access token + base URL in Settings |
| Google Gemini CLI | Access token + base URL in Settings |
| Z.AI | API key + base URL in Settings |
| GLM | API key + base URL in Settings |
| Vercel AI Gateway | API key in Settings |
| Cerebras | API key in Settings |
| Mistral | API key in Settings |
| GitHub Copilot | GitHub token in Settings |
| Moonshot (Kimi) | API key in Settings |
| Qwen Portal | API key in Settings |
| MiniMax | API key in Settings |
| MiniMax Portal | API key in Settings |
| Xiaomi MiMo | API key in Settings |
| Venice AI | API key in Settings |
| Synthetic | API key in Settings |
| Kimi Code | API key in Settings |
| OpenAI-Compatible (Custom) | API key + base URL in Settings |
| Anthropic-Compatible (Custom) | API key + base URL in Settings |

Advanced override: prompt caching can be disabled manually with `promptCaching.mode: "off"` in the saved LLM settings payload or by launching the app with `COWORK_PROMPT_CACHE_MODE=off`.

### Search Providers (Optional — DuckDuckGo works out of the box)

Web search works immediately via the built-in DuckDuckGo provider (free, no API key). For richer results (news, images, AI-optimized ranking), configure a paid provider in **Settings** > **Web Search**:

|----------|-------|
| DuckDuckGo | Built-in — no setup needed (automatic fallback) |
| Tavily | Enter API key from [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) |
| Exa | Enter API key from [exa.ai](https://exa.ai/) |
| Brave | Enter API key from [brave.com/search/api](https://brave.com/search/api) |

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

The app supports hot reload:

1. **React UI Changes**: Edit files in `src/renderer/` - auto-refreshes
2. **Electron Main Changes**: Edit files in `src/electron/` - auto-restarts
3. **Shared Types**: Edit `src/shared/types.ts` - both reload

### Project Structure

```

### Debugging

**Renderer Process (UI)**:
- DevTools open automatically in dev mode
- Use `console.log()` - shows in DevTools Console

**Main Process (Backend)**:
- Use `console.log()` - shows in terminal
- Check logs:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\cowork-os\\`

### Database

SQLite database location:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/cowork-os.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\cowork-os\\cowork-os.db`

View it with any SQLite browser or:
```bash
# macOS
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/cowork-os/cowork-os.db
.tables
SELECT * FROM tasks;
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
sqlite3 "$env:APPDATA\cowork-os\cowork-os.db"
.tables
SELECT * FROM tasks;
```

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build both renderer and electron
npm run build

# Package desktop app
npm run package
```

Output: `release/*.dmg` (macOS) and `release/*.exe` (Windows)

## Common Issues

### Issue: "No LLM provider configured"

**Solution**: Open Settings (gear icon) and configure at least one LLM provider.

### Issue: Electron won't start

**Solution**: Clear and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm run setup
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" for workspace

**Solution**: Choose a folder you have write access to, like:
- `~/Documents/cowork-test`
- `~/Downloads/test`

Don't use system folders like `/System` or `/Applications`.

### Issue: Tasks fail immediately

**Solution**: Check:
1. LLM provider is configured in Settings
2. API key is valid
3. Workspace has proper permissions
4. Network connection for API calls
5. Check console for error messages

### Issue: Ollama connection failed

**Solution**:
1. Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
2. Check URL is correct (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
3. Make sure you've pulled a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Clear task descriptions work better
2. **Start Small**: Test with a few files before bulk operations
3. **Review Plans**: Check the execution plan before it runs
4. **Respond Carefully**: Read approval requests and structured input prompts before accepting or submitting
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the timeline to understand what's happening, especially when parallel tool groups collapse into summary lanes
6. **Use Local Models**: Ollama is free and works offline

## Next Steps

### Try Advanced Features

1. **Web Search**: Configure a search provider and ask research questions
2. **Browser Automation**: Have the agent navigate websites and extract data
3. **Remote Access**: Set up WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Slack bot for mobile/remote access
4. **Document Creation**: Create professional Excel, Word, PDF, or PowerPoint files
5. **Goal Mode**: Define success criteria and let the agent auto-retry until verification passes
6. **Custom Skills**: Create reusable workflows with custom prompts in Settings > Custom Skills
7. **MCP Servers**: Connect to external tools via MCP in Settings > MCP Servers
8. **Enterprise Connectors**: Install from 44 connectors (Salesforce, Jira, HubSpot, Stripe, Tavily, Grafana, and more) via Settings > Connectors
9. **Cloud Storage**: Connect Notion, Box, OneDrive, Google Workspace (Gmail/Calendar/Drive), Dropbox, or SharePoint — click their cards in Settings > Integrations
10. **Parallel Tasks**: Run multiple tasks concurrently (configure in Settings > Task Queue)
11. **Guardrails**: Set token/cost budgets and blocked commands in Settings > Guardrails
