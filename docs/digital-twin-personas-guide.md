# Digital Twin Personas: Comprehensive Guide

Digital Twin Personas turn CoWork OS into a cognitive offload engine for every role in an organization. Each twin is an AI agent that continuously absorbs the repetitive information-gathering, status-tracking, and preparation work that fragments a person's attention throughout the day. The human focuses on judgment, relationships, and creative work. The twin handles everything else.

This guide covers the full system in detail: how twins work, what each built-in persona does, day-in-the-life scenarios for every role, and the broader set of job functions where digital twins can be applied.

## How Digital Twins Work

Heartbeat-enabled twins now use Heartbeat v3 by default. This guide focuses on persona behavior and scenarios; use [Heartbeat v3](heartbeat-v3.md) as the source of truth for runtime semantics.

A digital twin has two operational modes:

### Proactive Mode (Heartbeat v3)

The twin runs a configurable Pulse cadence (every 5 minutes to 4 hours by default). Pulse is cheap, deterministic, and non-LLM: it evaluates merged signals, due proactive work, due checklist items, and dispatch guardrails before deciding whether anything should escalate. A twin with a 30-minute Pulse cadence might review PR triage every 60 minutes but only Dispatch when signal strength, pending work, or checklist state justifies visible action.

Results may appear as no visible action, an internal suggestion, a heartbeat task, a runbook request, or a cron handoff. Mission Control shows the Pulse/Dispatch truth rather than assuming every wake becomes work.

### Reactive Mode (On-Demand)

The human assigns work directly:

- Drag a task onto the twin's column in the Mission Control Kanban board
- @mention the twin in a conversation: `@sw-twin summarize auth module changes this week`
- Invoke a bundled skill: `@twin prepare meeting brief for tomorrow's architecture review`
- Reach the twin via any of CoWork OS's 17 messaging channels (Slack, Teams, Discord, Email, Feishu/Lark, WeCom, etc.)

### What a Persona Template Contains

Each template is a JSON blueprint that bundles:

| Component | What It Defines |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Role configuration** | Capabilities (code, review, test, analyze, etc.), autonomy level (specialist or lead), personality profile, and a deep system prompt that defines the twin's behavior boundaries |
| **Heartbeat configuration** | Default Pulse cadence, dispatch cooldown, daily dispatch budget, heartbeat profile, active hours, and stagger support |
| **Cognitive offload categories** | Which types of mental work the twin absorbs (from a taxonomy of 10 categories) |
| **Proactive tasks** | 2-4 proactive tasks, each with a prompt template, frequency, execution mode, optional signal threshold, priority, and enabled/disabled flag |
| **Skill references** | Recommended skills the twin should have access to, with reasons and required/optional flags |
| **Metadata** | Category, tags, seniority range, and industry-agnostic flag for gallery filtering |

Activating a template creates a fully configured AgentRole in one click. After activation, every property is editable — the template is a starting point, not a constraint.

---

## The Cognitive Offload Model

Digital twins target 10 categories of work that fragment human attention. Every role has a different mix. The cognitive offload model maps each category to specific types of mental burden:

| Category | What It Absorbs | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Context Switching** | Gathering context when moving between projects, repos, or discussions | "What was the status of the auth migration when I left it Friday?" |
| **Status Reporting** | Compiling progress updates, standup summaries, sprint reviews, executive briefs | "Prepare my standup update from yesterday's git activity" |
| **Information Triage** | Filtering, prioritizing, and routing incoming information (PRs, issues, messages, alerts) | "Which of these 47 new issues actually need my attention?" |
| **Decision Preparation** | Assembling data, options, trade-offs, and recommendations for pending decisions | "What are the pros/cons of migrating to GraphQL vs. staying REST?" |
| **Documentation** | Keeping docs current, writing changelogs, maintaining audit trails | "Which docs are stale after this week's API changes?" |
| **Review Preparation** | Building review queues, risk assessments, checklists, and pre-review summaries | "Rank open PRs by risk and staleness for my review session" |
| **Dependency Tracking** | Monitoring external dependencies, vulnerabilities, upstream changes, blockers | "Are any of our npm packages affected by the latest CVE?" |
| **Compliance Checks** | Checking against standards, SLAs, regulatory requirements, internal policies | "Are we meeting our 99.9% uptime SLA this quarter?" |
| **Knowledge Curation** | Organizing, tagging, and surfacing institutional knowledge | "What design decisions were made about the notification system?" |
| **Routine Automation** | Handling repetitive checks, scheduled scans, and operational housekeeping | "Run the daily flaky test scan and report results" |

Each persona template declares 3-4 primary categories. These shape both the proactive tasks and the twin's general behavior when given ad-hoc work.

---

## Day-in-the-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Software Engineer — "Morning Code Review"

**7:30 AM** — You open your laptop. Your twin ran PR triage at 6:00 AM and again at 7:00 AM.

In Mission Control, you see a completed task: **PR Triage & Review Prep**. The output is a prioritized review queue:

```
1. [HIGH RISK] feat: rewrite auth middleware — 847 lines, touches 12 files, no tests added, open 3 days
2. [MEDIUM] fix: race condition in websocket handler — 23 lines, has tests, CI passing, open 1 day
3. [LOW] chore: update dependencies — 4 lines, lockfile only, open 2 hours
```

You start with the high-risk PR. Before diving in, you @mention your twin: `@sw-twin what's the context for the auth middleware rewrite?`. The twin summarizes the related issue, design discussion, and relevant architecture decisions.

**9:00 AM** — Standup. Your twin already ran `twin-status-report` at 8:30 AM. You paste the output:
- Completed: reviewed 3 PRs, fixed the caching bug (#412)
- In progress: auth service refactor (60% complete)
- Blocked: waiting on DB team for schema change

**2:00 PM** — You have an architecture meeting. Your twin ran `twin-meeting-prep` for "auth service architecture review", pulling together the original design doc, recent changes, open questions, and the 3 approaches discussed in Slack.

**4:00 PM** — The dependency health check flagged a CVE in a transitive dependency. You see: "Critical: CVE-2024-XXXX affects `jsonwebtoken@8.x`. Used in auth-service and api-gateway. Recommend upgrading to `jsonwebtoken@9.2.0`."

**Total time saved**: The engineer spent zero minutes gathering context for reviews, compiling standup notes, preparing for the meeting, or discovering the CVE. That work happened in the background.

---

### Scenario 2: Engineering Manager — "Sprint Planning Week"

**Monday morning** — Your twin's sprint health check shows: 73% sprint complete with 2 days remaining. Three items flagged at-risk: one blocked on another team, one with no updates for 4 days, one with failing CI.

You focus your Monday standup on the three flagged items instead of walking through every ticket.

**Before 1-on-1s** — Your twin prepared per-person briefs:
- **Sarah**: Completed the caching layer. Recognition-worthy: zero bugs in review. Potential concern: she hasn't taken PTO in 6 weeks.
- **Alex**: Blocked on the DB schema change since Thursday. Action from last 1-on-1: investigate GraphQL (still open).

You walk into each 1-on-1 with context instead of spending the first 5 minutes asking "so what are you working on?"

**Wednesday** — Cross-team dependency scan flagged: "Platform team's API deprecation (March 15) affects 3 of your team's services. No migration tickets exist yet." You create tickets and assign them before the deadline becomes a crisis.

**Friday** — Sprint retro. Your twin compiled: velocity trend (down 12% from last sprint), top blocker category (cross-team dependencies), PR review time (median 18 hours, up from 12).

---

### Scenario 3: Product Manager — "Feature Prioritization"

**Tuesday morning** — Your twin triaged 23 new feature requests overnight:
- 5 duplicates of existing requests (auto-grouped)
- 3 high-impact requests related to the new onboarding flow
- 1 request from a top-10 customer (flagged for priority)
- 14 low-priority or already-on-roadmap items

You review the 4 items that need your attention instead of all 23.

**Before sprint planning** — You need to decide whether to ship the dashboard redesign or the API v2 migration. You ask your twin: `@pm-twin prepare decision package for dashboard redesign vs API v2 migration`.

30 minutes later, the twin produces a decision package:
- Dashboard redesign: 3 sprints, affects 80% of daily users, high visibility, fully reversible
- API v2: 2 sprints, unblocks 5 integration partners, high revenue impact, harder to reverse
- Data: customer feedback weighted 3:1 toward API, but churn analysis shows dashboard UX is the #2 reason for churn
- Recommendation: API v2 first (revenue impact + partner commitments), dashboard in Q3

You adjust the recommendation based on context the twin doesn't have (board pressure on growth metrics) and walk into planning with a clear, data-backed proposal.

---

### Scenario 4: VP of Engineering — "Board Prep Week"

**Monday** — Your twin's executive brief lands with org-level metrics:
- Velocity: up 8% org-wide, but Team Bravo down 22% (investigated: key engineer on leave + infrastructure migration)
- Quality: defect escape rate improved from 2.3% to 1.8%
- Incidents: 3 P1s in Q4, down from 7 in Q3. Mean time to resolution: 47 minutes
- Hiring: 4 open roles, 12 candidates in pipeline, 2 offers out

**Wednesday** — OKR tracker shows:
- OKR 1 (Platform reliability): On track (99.95% uptime vs. 99.9% target)
- OKR 2 (Developer velocity): At risk (build times still 40% above target)
- OKR 3 (API v2 launch): Behind (blocked on partner testing)

You focus your leadership sync on OKR 2 and 3 instead of reviewing all objectives.

**Thursday** — Strategic risk scan flagged: "Two senior engineers on Team Alpha have accepted external offers (per HR data). Team Alpha owns the payment processing system. Risk: institutional knowledge loss in a critical system."

You escalate the retention issue before it becomes a surprise.

---

### Scenario 5: DevOps/SRE — "Incident Response Week"

**Monday 6 AM** — Your twin's security advisory scan found 2 new CVEs:
- Critical: CVE affecting your container runtime version. Actively exploited. Affected services: 12 of 47.
- Medium: CVE in a logging library. No known exploit. Affected services: 3.

You patch the critical CVE before most people start work.

**Wednesday** — Incident postmortem action tracker shows: "5 of 8 action items from last week's outage are complete. 2 are overdue: 'Add circuit breaker to payment service' (assigned to Sarah, overdue 3 days) and 'Update runbook for database failover' (unassigned)."

You reassign the stalled items in your daily standup.

**Friday** — SLA compliance report: "99.93% uptime this month against 99.9% SLA. Error budget consumed: 67%. Two services approaching budget limit: API gateway (82% consumed) and notification service (78% consumed)."

You proactively reduce deployment frequency for the at-risk services until the error budget recovers.

---

### Scenario 6: Data Scientist — "Model Monitoring"

**Morning** — Data quality monitor flagged: "Anomalous pattern in user_events table: NULL rate for `session_duration` jumped from 0.3% to 12.7% at 02:00 UTC. Likely cause: schema change in event producer service deployed at 01:45. Affected downstream: recommendation model training pipeline, daily analytics dashboard."

You alert the engineering team about the broken producer before the model retraining picks up bad data.

**Afternoon** — Experiment tracker shows: "A/B test 'new-onboarding-v2' at 73% of required sample size. Estimated 4 more days to statistical significance. Preliminary result: +6.2% activation rate (p=0.08, not yet significant). No data quality concerns."

You update stakeholders that results are trending positive but need more time, backed by actual statistical reasoning instead of gut feel.

---

### Scenario 7: Technical Writer — "Release Documentation"

**Monday** — Documentation freshness audit found:
- 4 API endpoints documented in `api-reference.md` no longer exist (removed in PR #891)
- The `configuration.md` guide references environment variables that were renamed last sprint
- 2 broken internal links in the getting-started guide

You fix the stale docs before users hit them.

**Thursday** — API changelog draft compiled from the week's PRs:
```
### Added
- POST /api/v2/webhooks - Register webhook endpoints
- GET /api/v2/analytics/export - Export analytics data

### Changed
- GET /api/v2/users - Added `include_inactive` query parameter
- POST /api/v2/tasks - `priority` field now accepts string values ("low", "medium", "high")

### Deprecated
- GET /api/v1/reports - Use /api/v2/analytics/export instead
```

You review, edit for clarity, and publish — instead of manually diffing PRs against docs.

## Scaling Across an Organization

Digital twins scale linearly. For a 100-person engineering organization:

| Role | Count | Template | Named Example |
|------|-------|----------|---------------|
| Software Engineers | 60 | Software Engineer | "Sarah's Twin", "Alex's Twin" |
| QA Engineers | 8 | System QA | "QA-Team-Alpha Twin" |
| DevOps/SRE | 5 | DevOps / SRE Engineer | "Platform Twin" |
| Engineering Managers | 8 | Engineering Manager | "Team-Bravo-EM Twin" |
| Product Managers | 6 | Product Manager | "Payments-PM Twin" |
| Data Scientists | 4 | Data Scientist / Analyst | "ML-Team Twin" |
| Technical Writers | 2 | Technical Writer | "Docs Twin" |
| Technical Directors | 3 | Technical Director | "Platform-Director Twin" |
| VP of Engineering | 1 | VP of Engineering | "VP-Eng Twin" |
| Hardware Engineers | 3 | Hardware Engineer | "HW-Team Twin" |

**Total: 100 twins serving 100 people.**

Each twin learns over time through CoWork OS's playbook and relationship memory systems. Corrections, preferences, and successful approaches get captured and reinforced. The knowledge graph builds organizational context (who owns what, cross-team dependencies) that all twins can reference.

### Organizational benefits at scale

- **Consistent reporting**: Every status report follows the same structure, making org-level aggregation trivial
- **Early warning system**: 100 twins scanning for risks means blockers, vulnerabilities, and drift get caught within hours, not weeks
- **Institutional memory**: Twins maintain context even when people are on vacation, change teams, or leave
- **Reduced meeting burden**: When every attendee's twin has prepared a brief, meetings start at "what should we decide?" instead of "let me share my screen and walk you through..."

## Creating Custom Templates

To add a persona for any job function:

1. Create a JSON file following the `PersonaTemplate` schema
2. Place it in `resources/persona-templates/`
3. Restart CoWork OS — the template appears in the gallery

### Template structure

```json
{
  "id": "your-role-id",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "Your Role Name",
  "description": "What this twin does for the human in this role.",
  "icon": "emoji",
  "color": "#hexcolor",
  "category": "engineering|management|product|data|operations",
  "role": {
    "capabilities": ["cap1", "cap2"],
    "autonomyLevel": "specialist|lead",
    "personalityId": "technical|professional",
    "systemPrompt": "Detailed behavior instructions...",
    "soul": "{\"name\":\"...\",\"role\":\"...\",\"personality\":\"...\",\"focusAreas\":[...]}"
  },
  "heartbeat": {
    "enabled": true,
    "pulseEveryMinutes": 30,
    "dispatchCooldownMinutes": 120,
    "maxDispatchesPerDay": 6,
    "heartbeatProfile": "observer"
  },
  "cognitiveOffload": {
    "primaryCategories": ["category-1", "category-2"],
    "proactiveTasks": [
      {
        "id": "task-id",
        "name": "Task Name",
        "description": "What this task does",
        "category": "offload-category",
        "promptTemplate": "The prompt used when Dispatch escalates this task...",
        "frequencyMinutes": 60,
        "executionMode": "dispatch",
        "minSignalStrength": 0.5,
        "priority": 1,
        "enabled": true
      }
    ]
  },
  "skills": [
    {"skillId": "skill-id", "reason": "Why this skill", "required": true}
  ],
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "seniorityRange": ["junior", "mid", "senior", "staff", "principal"],
  "industryAgnostic": true
}
```

### Design principles for good templates

- **System prompt**: Define what the twin does AND what it never does. Every template includes a clear "never does X without explicit approval" boundary.
- **Proactive tasks**: 2-4 tasks. Start with the most valuable one enabled, keep less critical ones disabled by default. Users enable them as they see the value.
- **Frequency**: Higher frequency for time-sensitive tasks (security scans, PR triage). Lower frequency for digest-style tasks (executive briefs, changelog drafts).
- **Execution mode**: Use `pulse_only` for cheap maintenance review, `dispatch` when escalation should create visible work, and `cron_handoff` for heavyweight or exact-time checks.
- **Priority**: Lower number = higher priority when multiple tasks are due in the same Pulse cycle.
- **Skills**: Mark skills as `required: true` only if the twin's core function depends on them. Optional skills extend capability but aren't essential.

## Channel Integration

Since CoWork OS supports 17 messaging channels, twins are accessible from any surface:

| Channel | Example Usage |
|---------|--------------|
| **Slack** | `/inbox @twin-engineering-manager prepare 1-on-1 notes for tomorrow` |
| **Microsoft Teams** | `@twin-sw-engineer summarize auth module changes this week` |
| **Discord** | `!ask @twin-devops check deployment pipeline status` |
| **Email** | Forward a thread to the twin for context extraction and summarization |
| **Telegram** | Send a message to the twin bot with a task description |
| **WhatsApp** | Quick voice-to-text task assignment |
| **iMessage** | Personal device access to your twin |
| **Signal** | Secure channel for sensitive queries |

Heartbeat results can be delivered to channels — e.g., post the daily PR triage to `#engineering-reviews` in Slack, or send the executive brief to the VP's email every morning.

## FAQ

**Can I have multiple twins of the same type?**
Yes. You might have a "Backend Twin" and a "Frontend Twin", both from the Software Engineer template but configured with different system prompts and proactive task priorities.

**Do twins talk to each other?**
Not directly. But twins share the same organizational knowledge graph and task system. An engineering manager twin can see the results produced by the software engineer twins on their team.

**What happens if a recommended skill is missing?**
The twin still works. Missing skills produce a warning during activation but don't prevent the twin from functioning. Proactive tasks and ad-hoc work still operate; the twin just can't invoke the specific skill.

**Can I change a twin's configuration after activation?**
Yes. An activated twin is a standard AgentRole. Edit any property via the Agent Role Editor in Mission Control: capabilities, autonomy, personality, system prompt, Pulse cadence, dispatch controls, heartbeat profile, and proactive task settings (in the soul JSON).

**How much does each twin cost in API usage?**
Depends on Pulse cadence, signal quality, profile, and task complexity. Heartbeat v3 is cheaper because Pulse is non-LLM and quiet by default; cost concentrates in Dispatch runs. An `observer` twin with a 30-minute Pulse cadence is usually far cheaper than the old "every wake might become work" model, while longer cadences remain appropriate for low-urgency roles.

**Can I use local LLMs for twins?**
Yes. CoWork OS supports 30+ LLM providers including Ollama for local models. Assign any model to a twin via the `modelKey` and `providerType` fields during activation.

**What data do twins have access to?**
Twins access the same data as any CoWork OS agent: the workspace's task history, git history, files, conversations, and knowledge graph. They don't have access to data outside what you've configured in your workspace.

**Can twins operate without heartbeat (purely reactive)?**
Yes. Disable heartbeat entirely to make the twin purely reactive. Setting a very long cadence also works, but `heartbeatEnabled: false` is the cleanest way to disable background Pulse activity.
