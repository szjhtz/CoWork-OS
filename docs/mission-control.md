# Mission Control

Mission Control is a centralized agent orchestration and monitoring dashboard. It provides a command center for managing agents, tracking tasks across a Kanban board, monitoring real-time activity, and overseeing team-based collaboration.

Access it from **Settings** > **Mission Control**. For company-ops workflows, you can also jump into it directly from **Settings** > **Companies** with the selected company preloaded.

Mission Control now sits alongside two other operational entry points:

- **Devices** for machine-level task routing and remote execution
- **Settings > Automations** for queueing, scheduling, triggers, briefing, and self-improvement policies
- **Settings > Companies** for company graph editing and operator assignment

## Layout

Mission Control is split into three panels:

| Panel | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Left — Agents** | Active agents list with status, heartbeat info, and wake controls |
| **Center — Mission Queue** | Kanban board with 5 columns for task lifecycle management |
| **Right — Feed & Details** | Live activity feed and selected task details with comments/mentions |

The header bar shows workspace selector, key stats (active agents, queued tasks, pending mentions), current time, and buttons for Teams, Reviews, and Standup.

---

## Agents Panel (Left)

View and manage all active agents in the current workspace.

### Agent Information

Each agent card shows:
- Display name, role description, and avatar
- Current active task title (or "No active task")
- **Autonomy level badge**: LEAD, SPC (Specialist), or INT (Intern)
- **Status indicator**: green dot (working), gray dot (idle), disabled (offline)
- Next scheduled heartbeat time

### Agent Actions

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Click** agent | Select/deselect — filters the activity feed to that agent |
| **Double-click** agent | Open Agent Role Editor to edit configuration |
| **"Wake Agent"** button | Manually trigger heartbeat immediately |
| **"Add Agent"** button | Create a new agent role with configuration modal |

### Agent Role Editor

Configure agent roles with:
- Display name, description, icon, and color
- Personality and model preferences
- Capabilities and tool restrictions
- Autonomy level (lead / specialist / intern)
- Heartbeat settings (enabled, interval, stagger offset)

---

## Mission Queue — Kanban Board (Center)

A 5-column Kanban board for managing the full task lifecycle. Drag tasks between columns to change their status.

| Column | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **INBOX** | Backlog | Unassigned items waiting for triage |
| **ASSIGNED** | Todo | Queued and assigned to agents |
| **IN PROGRESS** | Active | Currently being executed |
| **REVIEW** | Pending review | Awaiting approval or human review |
| **DONE** | Completed | Finished tasks |

### Task Cards

Each card shows:
- Task title
- Assigned agent (avatar + name)
- Status pill with color coding
- Time since last update (relative: "5m ago", "2h ago")

### Interactions

- **Drag and drop** tasks between columns to change status
- **Click** a task card to view its details in the right panel

---

## Feed & Task Details (Right)

Tabbed panel with three views.

### Live Feed Tab

Real-time activity stream for the current workspace.

**Filter by event type:**
- ALL — Everything
- TASKS — Task creation and status changes
- COMMENTS — Comments and mentions
- STATUS — Heartbeat status updates

**Filter by agent:** Click agent chips to show only that agent's activity.

**Event types shown:**
- Agent heartbeat events (started, found work, completed, errors)
- Task comments and mentions
- Task status changes
- Agent assignments

### Task Details Tab

Click any task card to see its full details:

- **Title and status** with color-coded pill
- **Assignment controls**: Change assignee (agent dropdown) and stage (column dropdown)
- **Task brief**: Full prompt/description
- **Updates**: Activity feed for this task with comment box to post updates
- **Mentions**: Create and manage mentions with status tracking (pending, acknowledged, completed, dismissed)

### Ops Tab

The `Ops` tab is the company-operations view used by the zero-human-company workflow.

It exposes:

- company snapshot
- goals and projects
- planner-managed issues
- planner-cycle issue drill-down
- issue comments
- issue execution runs
- run timeline events
- linked task navigation

Use it together with the strategic planner strip to watch company-level planning move into executable task work.

The `Ops` tab is most useful when the company graph is maintained in **Settings** > **Companies**, since that tab is where companies, goals, projects, issues, and linked operators are created and edited.

If the work itself is being executed on another machine, pair Mission Control with the **Devices** tab: Mission Control gives you company-level orchestration, while Devices gives you machine-level routing and remote task inspection.

---

## Strategic Planner Strip

Mission Control now includes a planner strip above the three-panel layout for company-ops configuration and review.

Available controls:

- company selector
- planner enabled/disabled toggle
- auto-dispatch toggle
- planner interval
- planning workspace selector
- planner-agent selector
- approval preset selector
- manual `Run Planner`
- recent planner cycle history

This is the main desktop entry point for zero-human-company planning loops.

Companies created in **Settings** > **Companies** appear here in the company selector. If you opened Mission Control from a company page, that company is preselected.

## Agent Teams

Access from the **Teams** button in the header. Full management UI for coordinated multi-agent collaboration.

- **Create teams**: Name, description, lead agent, max parallel agents, model and personality preferences
- **Manage members**: Add/remove agents, reorder, provide guidance
- **Create team runs**: Execute coordinated multi-agent tasks
- **Track items**: Shared checklists within a run with status tracking
- **Real-time events**: Live tracking of team activity (member changes, run status, item updates)

See [Features — Agent Teams](features.md#agent-teams) for more details.

---

## Digital Twin Personas

Access from the **Add Digital Twin** button in the agents panel (next to Add Agent).

Browse pre-built persona templates — Software Engineer, Engineering Manager, Product Manager, and more — and activate them in one click. Each twin comes pre-configured with:

- **Proactive heartbeat tasks** that run automatically (PR triage, status digests, dependency scans)
- **Cognitive offload categories** targeting the mental work that fragments focus
- **Recommended skills** for on-demand use (meeting prep, decision packages, status reports)

Mission Control is also the best place to monitor venture/operator twins such as:

- `Founder Office Operator`
- `Company Planner`
- `Growth Operator`
- `Customer Ops Lead`

If those twins were created from a company context, they still appear in Mission Control as normal agents, but they retain their company assignment for use in `Ops`, `Companies`, and company-aware Digital Twins views.

See [Digital Twins](digital-twins.md) for full documentation, enterprise scenarios, and template reference.

## Performance Reviews

Access from the **Reviews** button in the header.

- **Select agent** and review period (1-90 days, default 7)
- **Generate review**: Analyzes task completion rate, error rates, and autonomy effectiveness
- **View history**: Browse previous reviews per agent
- **Apply recommendation**: Auto-update an agent's autonomy level based on the review

---

## Standup Reports

Access from the **Standup** button in the header.

- **Generate standup**: Auto-generate a summary of recent workspace activity
- **View reports**: Browse up to 30 recent standup reports
- **Metrics included**: Completed tasks, in-progress tasks, blocked tasks with titles and statuses

| Event Stream | What It Updates |
