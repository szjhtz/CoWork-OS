# Permission System

CoWork OS uses a layered permission engine instead of a single risk-only approval gate.
The current model separates coarse capability gates from export-sensitive approvals so ordinary
network reads, raw outbound requests, and provenance-aware prompts can be handled differently
without flattening everything into one approval bucket.

## What The Engine Decides

Each tool request resolves to one of three outcomes:

- `allow` - execute immediately
- `deny` - block execution
- `ask` - prompt the user for approval

The decision includes:

- an exact reason code
- the matched rule or mode
- the scope that matched
- optional persistence targets for workspace or profile rules

## Evaluation Order

Permission evaluation runs in this order:

1. hard task restrictions and explicit task denylists
2. hard guardrails and dangerous-command blocks
3. coarse workspace capability gates
4. workspace policy script results
5. explicit permission rules
6. mode defaults
7. denial fallback escalation

Later stages never override earlier hard blocks.

## Rule Sources

Permission rules can come from several places:

- `session` - temporary grants and session-local rules stored in `SessionRuntime`
- `workspace_db` - workspace-local rules stored in SQLite
- `workspace_manifest` - checked-in workspace policy file at `.cowork/policy/permissions.json`
- `profile` - encrypted profile-level rules in secure settings
- `legacy_guardrails` - compatibility rules derived from older trusted-command patterns
- `legacy_builtin_settings` - compatibility rules derived from earlier settings models

When rules overlap, the more specific rule wins first. If specificity ties, the source priority is:

`session > workspace_db > workspace_manifest > profile > legacy_* > mode`

If source priority also ties, the effect priority is:

`deny > ask > allow`

## Scope Types

The engine supports five explicit rule scopes:

- `tool` - match a single tool by name
- `domain` - match a destination domain, optionally scoped to one tool such as `web_fetch` or `http_request`
- `path` - match a tool and absolute path prefix
- `command_prefix` - match a normalized shell command prefix
- `mcp_server` - match a specific MCP server backend

Domain names are normalized to lowercase hostnames. Path scopes are normalized to absolute paths.
Command prefixes are whitespace-normalized before comparison. MCP server names are normalized for
stable matching.

## Permission Modes

Default behavior depends on the selected permission mode:

- `default` - allow safe reads, ask on writes, deletes, shell, data export, external services, and side-effecting MCP tools
- `plan` - allow read-only tools, deny mutating and external tools by default
- `accept_edits` - allow in-workspace file edits and reads, ask on deletes, shell, data export, network side effects, and external services
- `dangerous_only` - allow safe reads, in-workspace edits, and a conservative read/test shell allowlist; ask on deletes, browser/system/computer actions, `run_applescript`, data export, MCP tools, external side effects, and ambiguous shell commands
- `dont_ask` - allow anything not hard-blocked or explicitly denied, except `data_export`, which still prompts
- `bypass_permissions` - skip prompts and ask-rules for normal actions, but still enforce hard guardrails, task restrictions, workspace capability gates, explicit deny rules, and explicit `data_export` prompts

`dangerous_only` is intentionally conservative for shell access. Known read/test commands can run without a prompt, but composite shell expressions and commands with unclear side effects still pause for approval.

`dont_ask` and `bypass_permissions` are no longer wildcard escape hatches for outbound transfer.
If the request is classified as `data_export`, the engine switches back to an explicit approval.

## Core Automation Defaults

Always-on core automation does not rely on `bypass_permissions` by default.

Instead, core-created automated tasks inherit an autonomy policy that:

- disables interactive user-input pauses
- seeds an explicit allowlist of automation-safe approval types instead of using a wildcard
- auto-approves `run_command` by default for deep-work style automation
- can also auto-approve `network_access` and `external_service` for trusted operator work when the task or operator policy opts in
- does not auto-approve `data_export`
- still preserves hard guardrails, workspace capability denials, and explicit deny rules

This is the default posture for the Heartbeat/Subconscious core runtime because it keeps routine operator work flowing without turning the permission system off.

In other words:

- **core automation uses stronger allow rules**
- **it does not skip the permission engine entirely**

An explicit empty `autoApproveTypes` list is also preserved as empty. CoWork no longer silently
falls back to "approve everything" when a policy intended to be narrow.

## Export-Sensitive Approvals

CoWork now treats outbound data movement as its own approval lane: `data_export`.

Requests enter that lane when a tool could send workspace or imported content to an external
service, even if the tool looks read-like from the user perspective.

Current examples:

- `http_request` with a mutating method or request payload is treated as `data_export`
- plain `http_request` only stays in `network_access` when it is a simple `GET` or `HEAD` with no body and no custom headers
- `analyze_image` is treated as export because image bytes are sent to an external vision model
- `read_pdf_visual` is treated as export because PDF page images are sent to an external vision model

By contrast, Chronicle's `screen_context_resolve` is a **local screen-context lookup**. It can read from the local passive Chronicle buffer and optionally capture a fresh local screenshot, but it does not itself export screenshot bytes to an external provider. If the task later sends an image to a provider through `analyze_image` or another export-sensitive path, that later step still enters the normal `data_export` approval lane.

This is separate from the coarse workspace `network` capability:

- `network: false` still blocks all network-capable and export-capable tools at the workspace boundary
- `network: true` only means those tools are eligible to run; export-sensitive requests may still pause for approval
- domain-scoped rules can narrow `web_fetch` and `http_request` to approved destinations without globally opening network egress

The session-level "Approve all" convenience toggle also stays narrow. It can auto-approve
`run_command` and `network_access`, but not `data_export`.

## Denial Fallback

Soft denials are not always the end of the story.

CoWork tracks denial counts per permission fingerprint in `SessionRuntime`:

- `3` consecutive soft denials trigger fallback escalation
- `20` total soft denials trigger fallback escalation

When a fingerprint crosses the threshold, the next evaluation can surface a direct prompt instead
of silently repeating the same denial path.

Hard denials from guardrails, workspace capability gates, and explicit deny rules are never
overridden by fallback.

## Persistence Destinations

Different rule sources persist in different places:

- session rules and temporary grants live in `SessionRuntime` snapshots
- workspace-local rules are stored in SQLite and mirrored to `.cowork/policy/permissions.json`
- profile rules are stored in encrypted secure settings

Workspace-local rule removal updates both the database row and the manifest mirror. If the
manifest write fails, the database removal still succeeds and the UI reports the partial state.

## User Surfaces

Users can manage permission state from two places:

- approval prompts, which can create one-shot or persisted rules
- Settings > System & Security, which manages default mode, profile rules, and workspace-local rules

The workspace-rule panel lets users browse and remove workspace-local rules directly without having
to wait for another approval prompt.

## Provenance-Aware Approval Context

Approval prompts now include security context when the action could move data outward.

The current flow is:

- imported files are recorded as `user_imported_external`
- drag-and-drop or clipboard-backed files are recorded as `clipboard_or_drag_data`
- gateway and channel attachments are recorded as `channel_attachment`
- reads from those files prepend an explicit untrusted-content banner
- the task runtime tracks recent sensitive or untrusted sources read during the session
- export approvals surface the destination plus the direct source and recent-read hints when available

This keeps rich features intact, but makes it much harder for hidden instructions in imported
content to silently trigger an outbound action.

## Runtime Integration

`SessionRuntime` owns the session-local permission state and snapshot persistence.
`TaskExecutor` delegates permission decisions to the runtime and keeps only task bootstrap,
finalization, and UI projection responsibilities.

The always-on automation runtime layers on top of this by spawning tasks with explicit autonomy presets rather than depending on manual approval toggles.
