## How It Works

### Execution Flow

```
1. User selects workspace folder
   |
2. User creates task with description
   |
3. AgentDaemon starts TaskExecutor
   |
4. TaskExecutor calls LLM (any configured provider) to create plan
   |
5. For each plan step:
   - LLM decides which tools to use
   - TaskExecutor calls tools via ToolRegistry
   - Tools perform operations (with permission checks)
   - Results sent back to LLM
   - Events logged and streamed to UI
   |
6. If approval needed:
   - TaskExecutor pauses
   - ApprovalDialog shown to user
   - User approves/denies
   - Execution continues or fails
   |
7. Task completes
   - Status updated to "completed"
   - All events logged in database
   - Artifacts tracked
```

### Permission Model

```
Workspace Permissions:
├── Read: Enabled by default
├── Write: Enabled by default
├── Delete: Enabled, requires approval
├── Network: Enabled (for web search)
└── Shell: Requires approval

Operations Requiring Approval:
├── Delete file
├── Delete multiple files
├── Bulk rename (>10 files)
├── Shell command execution
└── External service calls
```

## What's NOT Implemented (Planned)

### VM Sandbox

- **What's needed**:
  - macOS Virtualization.framework integration
  - Linux VM image
  - Workspace mount
  - Network egress controls

### Sub-Agents
- **Status**: Not started
- **What's needed**:
  - Agent pool management
  - Task splitting logic
  - Result merging
  - Resource allocation

## Ready to Use

### You Can:
1. Select workspaces and create tasks
2. Use any configured LLM provider, including local Ollama and 30+ supported provider/gateway options
3. Execute multi-step file operations
4. Create real Office documents (.xlsx, .docx, .pdf, .pptx)
5. Search the web with multiple providers
6. Automate browser interactions
7. Run tasks remotely via WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or Slack
8. Track all agent activity in real-time
9. Approve/deny destructive operations
10. Receive automatic updates

16. Use system tools (screenshots, clipboard, open apps)
17. View artifacts with the in-app file viewer
18. Customize agent personality via Settings or conversation prompts
19. Use "Think With Me" mode for brainstorming and decision-making

4. Workspace selector appears
5. Configure API credentials in Settings (gear icon)

## Performance Characteristics

### Token Usage (varies by provider)
- **Plan creation**: ~500-1000 tokens
- **Step execution**: ~1000-3000 tokens per step
- **Average task**: 5000-10000 tokens total

### Timing
- **Plan creation**: 2-5 seconds
- **Simple file operation**: 3-6 seconds per step
- **Document creation**: 5-10 seconds
- **Browser automation**: 2-10 seconds per action
- **Web search**: 1-3 seconds

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~200-400MB (Electron + Playwright when active)
- **Database**: <1MB per task
- **CPU**: Minimal (except during API calls)

## Summary

**CoWork OS is a production-ready, security-first personal AI assistant platform:**

### Core Strengths
- **Security**: 3200+ tests, configurable guardrails, approval workflows, brute-force protection
