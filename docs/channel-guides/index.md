# Channel-Specific User Guides

These guides explain how to use each CoWork channel after it is connected. They are written for end users: what the channel is best for, which features matter, how to work day to day, and what to avoid.

For setup instructions, see [Channel Integrations](../channels.md). For shared remote commands and task lifecycle behavior, see [Using CoWork from WhatsApp and Other Channels](../gateway-user-guide.md) and [Gateway Message Lifecycle](../gateway-message-lifecycle.md).

## Shared Commands

Most channels support the same remote lifecycle commands once messages reach CoWork:

- `/commands` shows the command catalog.
- `/new` starts the next message fresh without cancelling the old task.
- `/new temp` starts a scratch temporary session.
- `/stop` cancels the active task.
- `/queue <message>` sends explicit follow-up text to the current task.
- `/steer <guidance>` gives high-priority direction to the active task.
- `/background <prompt>` starts unlinked side work.
- `/skills` lists enabled skills.

Platform details vary. Slack slash commands must be registered in Slack first, Discord and Telegram expose native command menus, and some channels are text-only or rate-limited.
