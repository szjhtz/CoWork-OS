# CoWork OS Reference (What It Is, What It Does, How It Works)

This is the **living reference** for CoWork OS.

- Audience: contributors and power users who want a single place to understand the system.
- Scope: product capabilities, architecture, major subsystems, data storage, security model, and repo map.
- Update rule: **if a change affects behavior, capabilities, defaults, or architecture, update this file in the same PR**.
- Note: this file is also used as an optional "map" for the Memory Kit context injector (`src/electron/memory/WorkspaceKitContext.ts`), so keep the top section high-signal.

If you are looking for setup and usage docs first, start with:
- `README.md`
- `GETTING_STARTED.md`

## What CoWork OS Is

CoWork OS is a **local-first, security-first desktop runtime** for running AI agents with:
- A task execution engine (plan -> execute -> observe loops)
- A tool runtime (file ops, web, browser automation, shell, integrations)
- Messaging gateways (WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/Slack/Teams/etc.) so you can interact with your agent remotely
- Extensibility via MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and connectors

The app is built as an **Electron main process** (backend/orchestration) plus a **React renderer** (UI).

CoWork OS also supports **server/headless deployments** intended for Linux VPS installs:

- Headless Electron daemon: `bin/coworkd.js`
- Node-only daemon (no Electron/Xvfb): `bin/coworkd-node.js` (entry: `src/daemon/main.ts`)

See: `docs/vps-linux.md`.

## What CoWork OS Can Do (Capabilities)

### 1. Run Tasks (Agent Runtime)

- Create tasks in a selected **workspace folder** and watch execution via an event timeline.
- Execute steps by calling tools (file ops, browser automation, search, connectors, etc.).
- Pause for **approvals** before destructive or high-risk actions, and for **structured input requests** when the plan needs a concrete user choice.

Key code:
- Agent orchestration: `src/electron/agent/daemon.ts`, `src/electron/agent/executor.ts`, `src/electron/agent/queue-manager.ts`
- Tool runtime: `src/electron/agent/tools/registry.ts`

#### Intent Routing & Strategy Layer

Each task prompt is classified by `IntentRouter` into one of five intent types (`chat`, `advice`, `planning`, `execution`, `mixed`) with a confidence score. `TaskStrategyService` then derives execution defaults (conversation mode, max turns, quality passes, answer-first bias, bounded research, timeout-finalize bias, turn-budget policy, workspace alias policy, task-root policy, and follow-up recovery defaults) from the classified intent. Strategy is applied at task creation in the daemon and re-applied when queued tasks are dequeued, while `executionModeSource` preserves whether a read-only mode came from the user or from strategy inference.

Key code:
- Intent classifier: `src/electron/agent/strategy/IntentRouter.ts`
- Strategy service: `src/electron/agent/strategy/TaskStrategyService.ts`
- Strategy integration: `src/electron/agent/daemon.ts` (task creation), `src/electron/agent/context-manager.ts` (context injection)

#### Structured Input Requests

When a propose-mode task needs a real decision, the executor can require `request_user_input` instead of continuing with an ambiguous free-text question. The flow is:

- the tool creates an `input_requests` record and pauses the task
- the desktop UI renders the request as an inline multiple-choice card
- control-plane operators can list/respond to the same request remotely
- submitted answers resume execution; dismissed requests keep the task paused or reject the waiting branch

This keeps "need user choice" states explicit and recoverable across app restarts.

Key code:
- Tool surface: `src/electron/agent/tools/registry.ts`
- Persistence + resume: `src/electron/agent/daemon.ts`, `src/electron/database/repositories.ts`
- IPC / control plane: `src/electron/ipc/handlers.ts`, `src/daemon/control-plane-methods.ts`
- Renderer surfaces: `src/renderer/App.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/MainContent.tsx`

#### Completion Contract & Timeout Recovery

The executor tracks cancellation reasons (`user`, `timeout`, `shutdown`, `system`) and uses a completion-first approach where the agent is biased to provide an answer before performing tool work. On timeout, `finalizeWithTimeoutRecovery()` attempts a best-effort finalization pass that produces a partial answer rather than an empty failure. Retry logic includes adaptive token capping (`applyRetryTokenCap`) and timeout scaling (`getRetryTimeoutMs`) informed by observed output tokens/sec.

Key code:
- Timeout recovery: `src/electron/agent/executor.ts` (`finalizeWithTimeoutRecovery`, `finalizeTaskBestEffort`, `buildTimeoutRecoveryAnswer`)
- Retry helpers: `src/electron/agent/executor.ts` (`applyRetryTokenCap`, `getRetryTimeoutMs`, `isAbortLikeError`)

#### Turn-Budget, Context, and Path Recovery

Recent executor hardening adds several recovery layers that now shape default runtime behavior:

- execute-oriented tasks default to `adaptive_unbounded` turn policy, treating per-window exhaustion as a soft event and attempting a bounded follow-up recovery before safety-stop escalation
- context-capacity failures are classified separately so the executor can compact messages and retry instead of immediately failing the task
- absolute `/workspace/...` aliases can be normalized back into the active workspace for file/directory tools
- relative path drift can be repaired under a pinned task root (`pin_and_rewrite`) or blocked under strict policy (`strict_fail`)
- recoverable path drift can suppress tool disablement while retry budget remains, avoiding false "dead tool" states from path-only mistakes
- parallel read-only tool batches emit grouped lane events so timeline rendering can summarize concurrent work without flooding the feed

Key code:
- Runtime policy + recovery: `src/electron/agent/executor.ts`, `src/electron/agent/executor-helpers.ts`, `src/electron/agent/executor-loop-utils.ts`
- Path normalization helpers: `src/electron/agent/path-alias.ts`, `src/electron/agent/tools/file-tools.ts`
- Timeline grouping: `src/electron/agent/timeline-emitter.ts`, `src/renderer/components/timeline/parallel-group-projection.ts`

#### Completion Output Summary & Renderer Confidence

To make “task done + file ready” unambiguous in the UI, completion events can now carry structured output metadata. The executor computes `TaskOutputSummary` at completion with a created-first rule:

- Primary signal: created outputs (`file_created`, `artifact_created`)
- Fallback signal: modified outputs (`file_modified`) only when no created outputs exist
- Normalized fields: `created`, optional `modifiedFallback`, `primaryOutputPath`, `outputCount`, `folders`

`AgentDaemon.completeTask(...)` passes this as optional `payload.outputSummary` on `task_completed`. Renderer code resolves outputs from this payload first, then falls back to event-derivation for backward compatibility with older tasks/events.

Completion UX behavior built on this contract:

- Output-aware completion toasts with direct file actions (`Open file`, `Show in Finder`, `View in Files`)
- Automatic right-panel expansion + output highlight for the currently selected completed task
- Unseen-output badge when completion happens outside the active task/view
- Files section emphasis (primary output highlight + location context line) while keeping filename-only rows
- `artifact_created` parity in summary/technical timelines and child-task merge flows

Key code:
- Summary computation + completion wiring: `src/electron/agent/executor.ts`, `src/electron/agent/daemon.ts`
- Child-event merge parity: `src/electron/ipc/handlers.ts`
- Bridge allowlist parity: `src/electron/control-plane/task-event-bridge-contract.ts`
- Renderer output derivation: `src/renderer/utils/task-outputs.ts`
- Renderer completion decisions/actions: `src/renderer/utils/task-completion-ux.ts`
- Timeline visibility rules: `src/renderer/utils/task-event-visibility.ts`
- UI integration: `src/renderer/App.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/MainContent.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/RightPanel.tsx`

### 2. Use Tools and Skills

CoWork OS exposes "tools" to the agent. Tools include:
- Filesystem: read/write/list/rename/delete, safe path handling
- Code navigation/editing: `glob`, `grep`, `edit_file`
- Web search + web fetch (multi-provider)
- Browser automation (Playwright)
- Shell execution (sandboxed + approvals)
- Vision: analyze workspace images (screenshots/photos) via `analyze_image`
- Image generation: `generate_image` with multi-provider support (Gemini, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI) and automatic provider selection
- Visual annotation: `visual_open_annotator` / `visual_update_annotator` for iterative image refinement via Live Canvas
- Apple Calendar: create, update, delete calendar events via `apple_calendar_action` (macOS AppleScript)
- Apple Reminders: create, complete, update, list reminders via `apple_reminders_action` (macOS AppleScript)
- Integrations: Google Drive/Gmail/Calendar, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive, SharePoint, Notion
- Web scraping: advanced scraping via Scrapling (anti-bot bypass, stealth browsers, structured extraction) through Python bridge
- MCP tools from external MCP servers

Headless mode:
- When running in headless/daemon mode, `SystemTools.getToolDefinitions({ headless: true })` returns a reduced subset (system_info, get_env, get_app_paths, search_memories) — clipboard, screenshot, open_application, open_url, and other desktop-only tools are excluded.
- `memory_save` is always available (including headless) for agents to explicitly persist insights, decisions, observations, and errors during task execution.

Key code:
- Tool registry and execution: `src/electron/agent/tools/registry.ts`
- Apple Calendar tools: `src/electron/agent/tools/apple-calendar-tools.ts`
- Apple Reminders tools: `src/electron/agent/tools/apple-reminders-tools.ts`
- Image generation: `src/electron/agent/skills/image-generator.ts`
- Visual annotation tools: `src/electron/agent/tools/visual-tools.ts`
- Sandbox runner: `src/electron/agent/sandbox/runner.ts`
- Scraping tools: `src/electron/agent/tools/scraping-tools.ts`
- Scraping bridge (Python): `src/electron/scraping/scrapling-bridge.py`
- Scraping settings: `src/electron/scraping/scraping-settings.ts`
- Built-in skill definitions (prompted workflows): `resources/skills/`
- Skill loading precedence: `src/electron/agent/custom-skill-loader.ts`

Notes on "skills":
- Skills are JSON files (`*.json`) that define reusable workflows/prompts.
- Skill sources and precedence (highest wins):
  - Workspace skills: `<workspace>/skills/`
  - Managed skills: Electron `userData/skills/` (on macOS typically `~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/skills/`)
  - Bundled skills: `resources/skills/` (includes use-case templates: booking options, draft reply, family digest, household capture, newsletter digest, transaction scan, inbox manager, chief-of-staff briefing, smart-home brain, dev task queue, figure-it-out agent)
- Managed and workspace skills can also use a sibling directory named after the skill ID (for example `webxr-dev.json` plus `webxr-dev/`). When present, `{baseDir}` resolves to that sibling directory so the skill can load `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and `scripts/`.

### 3. Messaging Gateway (Channels)

CoWork OS can run as a multi-channel gateway, letting users message the agent via supported platforms.

Implemented channel adapters live in: `src/electron/gateway/channels/`

Current built-in channels (see files in that folder):
- WhatsApp
- Telegram
- Discord
- Slack
- Microsoft Teams
- Google Chat
- iMessage
- Signal
- Mattermost
- Matrix
- Twitch
- LINE
- BlueBubbles
- Email
- X (Twitter)

Core gateway code:
- Gateway manager: `src/electron/gateway/index.ts`
- Router: `src/electron/gateway/router.ts`
- Shared channel types: `src/electron/gateway/channels/types.ts`

Channel commands (chat):
- `/inbox [triage|autopilot|followups] [limit]` runs DM-only inbox triage workflow with confirmation gates for external actions.
- `/brief [morning|today|tomorrow|week]` generates a DM-only chief-of-staff style brief.
- `/simplify [objective] [--domain ...] [--scope ...]` runs deterministic simplify skill expansion for quality tuning in any domain.
- `/batch <objective> [--parallel ...] [--domain ...] [--external ...]` runs deterministic batch skill expansion for parallelizable migration/transform workflows in any domain.
- `/schedule ...` creates scheduled agent tasks that deliver results back to the originating chat (works in DM + group contexts).
- `/digest [lookback]` generates an on-demand digest of recent chat messages (group-safe; uses the local channel message store).
- `/followups [lookback]` extracts follow-ups/commitments from recent chat messages (group-safe; uses the local channel message store).
- `/activation [on|off]` toggles channel activation state.
- `/memorytrust [on|off]` toggles memory trust for the channel (controls whether agent stores memories from this channel).
- `/selfchat [on|off]` toggles self-message capture mode.
- `/ambient [on|off]` toggles ambient mode (ingest-only, no agent replies for non-command messages).
- `/ingest [on|off]` toggles ingest-only mode for the channel.
- `/prefix [text|clear]` sets or clears a response prefix for agent replies on this channel.
- `/numbers` lists allowed phone numbers for the channel.
- `/allow <number>` adds a phone number to the channel allowlist.
- `/disallow <number>` removes a phone number from the channel allowlist.

Command parsing for `/simplify` and `/batch` (including inline chaining and normalization) is centralized in:

- `src/shared/skill-slash-commands.ts`

Behavior notes:

- Direct slash commands invoke `use_skill` deterministically in executor before normal planning/execution.
- Inline `then run /simplify` and `then run /batch` chaining is normalized into same-task follow-up workflow execution.
- `/batch` external policy is enforced at runtime:
  - `confirm` requests explicit non-auto approval before first side-effect external action.
  - `none` blocks known external side-effect external actions for the run.

For end-user syntax and policy examples, see [Universal `/simplify` and `/batch`](simplify-batch.md).

Attachment handling:
- If an inbound channel message includes `attachments`, the gateway persists them under `<workspace>/.cowork/inbox/attachments/...`
- The persisted workspace paths are appended into the task prompt so agents can inspect them with normal file tools (and `analyze_image` for images)
- File extraction supports DOCX/PDF/PPTX content, and local image previews can optionally run OCR when `tesseract` is available

Channel operational modes:
- **Ambient mode**: When `ambientMode` is enabled on a channel config, all non-slash-command messages are ingested (persisted to the local message store) but NOT routed to the agent. Slash commands and pairing codes still pass through. Unauthorized messages are silently dropped (no error reply).
- **Self-message capture**: Channels with `captureSelfMessages` enabled (WhatsApp, iMessage, BlueBubbles) ingest outgoing user messages as `direction: 'outgoing_user'` with `ingestOnly: true`, providing conversation context without triggering reply loops.

Security modes commonly used by channels:
- `pairing`: require a pairing code
- `allowlist`: require explicit allowlisting
- `open`: no pairing/allowlist gate (still subject to tool policy)

Per-context policy:
- CoWork OS supports different tool/security restrictions for DM vs group contexts.
- See: `docs/security/trust-boundaries.md` and `src/electron/security/policy-manager.ts`

### 4. LLM Providers (BYOK) + Search Providers

LLM providers are configured in Settings (encrypted at rest) and billed directly by the provider.

Provider code:
- LLM providers: `src/electron/agent/llm/`
- LLM provider types: `src/shared/types.ts` (`LLM_PROVIDER_TYPES`)
- Search providers: `src/electron/agent/search/`

### 5. MCP (Model Context Protocol)

CoWork OS supports MCP in two directions:
- **MCP client**: connect to external MCP servers and import their tools into the agent
- **MCP host**: expose CoWork OS tools as an MCP server (stdio)

Key code:
- MCP client: `src/electron/mcp/client/`
- MCP host server: `src/electron/mcp/host/MCPHostServer.ts`
- Registry/one-click installs: `src/electron/mcp/registry/MCPRegistryManager.ts`

Enterprise connectors included in this repo (as MCP servers):
- `connectors/*-mcp/` (Salesforce, Jira, HubSpot, Zendesk, ServiceNow, Linear, Asana, Okta, Resend)
- Reference doc: `docs/enterprise-connectors.md`

### 6. Memory System (Local-First)

CoWork OS can store and retrieve local memories per workspace, with:
- Auto-capture from task execution
- **Agent-initiated memory save** via `memory_save` tool — agents can explicitly persist insights, decisions, observations, and errors during task execution for recall in future sessions
- Privacy protection (sensitive detection, private memories)
- Search + progressive retrieval — `search_memories` searches both the memory DB and `.cowork/` workspace markdown files
- Optional workspace kit (`.cowork/`) initialization + indexing for durable human-edited context
- Project contexts under `.cowork/projects/<projectId>/` with per-project access rules
- ChatGPT export import (distilled via LLM, stored locally)
- Cross-workspace search for imported ChatGPT memories (`searchImportedGlobal`)
- Local vector embeddings for memory similarity (no external API required)

Key code:
- Memory service: `src/electron/memory/MemoryService.ts`
- Memory tools (agent-initiated save): `src/electron/agent/tools/memory-tools.ts`
- Local embeddings: `src/electron/memory/local-embedding.ts`
- Workspace kit extraction: `src/electron/memory/WorkspaceKitContext.ts`
- Markdown indexing + redaction: `src/electron/memory/MarkdownMemoryIndexService.ts`
- ChatGPT importer: `src/electron/memory/ChatGPTImporter.ts`
- Embedding repository: `src/electron/database/repositories.ts` (`MemoryEmbeddingRepository`)
 - Project access rules: `src/electron/security/project-access.ts`

Docs:
- Security-focused memory guidance: `docs/security/best-practices.md`
- Relationship agent architecture: `docs/relationship-agent-architecture.md`

#### Relationship Memory

Layered continuity memory that persists user identity, preferences, working context, interaction history, and commitments across sessions. `RelationshipMemoryService` manages five memory layers with upsert deduplication and builds a prompt context block injected into task execution. `UserProfileService` extracts user facts from messages and feedback, compositing them with relationship memory for personalization. The daemon records relationship memory entries on task completion.

Key code:
- Relationship memory: `src/electron/memory/RelationshipMemoryService.ts`
- User profile extraction: `src/electron/memory/UserProfileService.ts`
- IPC handlers: `src/electron/ipc/handlers.ts` (`memory:relationshipList`, `memory:relationshipUpdate`, `memory:relationshipDelete`, `memory:commitmentsGet`, `memory:commitmentsDueSoon`)
- UI: `src/renderer/components/MemorySettings.tsx`

### 7. Live Canvas (Agent-Driven UI)

Live Canvas lets agents render and interact with dynamic HTML/CSS/JS during a task (with in-app preview).

Docs:
- `docs/live-canvas.md`

Code:
- Canvas runtime: `src/electron/canvas/`
- IPC handlers: `src/electron/ipc/canvas-handlers.ts`

### 8. Scheduling (Cron) + Webhook Ingress (Hooks)

Scheduling:
- Cron jobs can create tasks on schedules (`at`, `every`, `cron`) and optionally deliver results to channels.
- When scheduling from the global temp workspace, a dedicated managed workspace is auto-created under `<userDataDir>/scheduled-workspaces/` to ensure job persistence.
- Cron webhooks can trigger jobs externally (disabled by default).
- For noisy monitors, delivery can be configured to only post on success when a non-empty result is available (used by `/schedule ... --if-result ...`).
- Job prompts support template variables such as `{{today}}`, `{{tomorrow}}`, `{{week_end}}`, `{{now}}`.
- If a job is configured with channel delivery (for example jobs created via `/schedule`), prompts can also use:
  - `{{chat_messages}}` (recent incoming messages for that chat)
  - `{{chat_since}}`, `{{chat_until}}` (ISO timestamps for the rendered window)
  - `{{chat_message_count}}`, `{{chat_truncated}}`

Code:
- Cron service: `src/electron/cron/service.ts`
- Cron types: `src/electron/cron/types.ts`

Defaults (see `src/electron/main.ts`):
- Cron webhook port: `9876` (disabled by default)

Webhook ingress ("Hooks"):
- Hooks provide a small HTTP server for "wake" and isolated agent runs, plus Gmail watcher support.

Code:
- Hooks server: `src/electron/hooks/server.ts`
- Hooks settings: `src/electron/hooks/settings.ts`
- Hooks types/defaults: `src/electron/hooks/types.ts`

Defaults:
- Hooks port: `9877` (when enabled)
- Hooks base path: `/hooks`

### 9. Control Plane (WebSocket Remote Management)

Control Plane is a local WebSocket server for remote clients (default loopback-only for safety).
It can be exposed via SSH tunnels or Tailscale (Serve/Funnel).

Docs:
- `docs/remote-access.md`

Web UI:
- The control plane serves a built-in HTML dashboard at `/` (same host/port) for headless management.
- Manage LLM setup, tasks, approvals, pending structured input requests, workspaces, and channels from a browser via SSH tunnel or Tailscale.
- Code: `src/electron/control-plane/web-ui.ts`

Code:
- Control plane server: `src/electron/control-plane/server.ts`
- Control plane protocol: `src/electron/control-plane/protocol.ts`
- Web UI: `src/electron/control-plane/web-ui.ts`
- Tailscale integration: `src/electron/tailscale/`

Defaults:
- Bind host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `18789`

Capabilities:
- Operators can manage workspaces and tasks remotely over WebSocket.
- Authentication yields different client roles:
  - `operator` clients get `admin` scope (full task/workspace access, can create/cancel tasks).
  - `node` clients (mobile companions) get `read` scope and receive **redacted** task/workspace views (no prompts, no local filesystem paths).

Key methods (see `src/electron/control-plane/protocol.ts`):
- Workspaces: `workspace.list`, `workspace.get`
- Workspaces (admin): `workspace.create`
- Tasks: `task.create`, `task.get`, `task.list`, `task.cancel`, `task.sendMessage`
- Tasks (admin): `task.events`
- Approvals (admin): `approval.list`, `approval.respond`
- Structured input (admin): `input_request.list`, `input_request.respond`
- Channels: `channel.list`, `channel.get`
- Channels (admin): `channel.create`, `channel.update`, `channel.test`, `channel.enable`, `channel.disable`, `channel.remove`
- Managed accounts: `account.list`, `account.get`
- Managed accounts (admin): `account.upsert`, `account.remove`
- LLM setup (admin): `llm.configure`
- Config/Health: `config.get` (sanitized, no secrets)

Key events:
- `task.event` is broadcast to **operators only** (payloads are sanitized and size-capped).
- Node lifecycle + capability events: `node.connected`, `node.disconnected`, `node.capabilities_changed`, `node.event`.

### 10. Voice

Voice capabilities include:
- TTS/STT in the desktop app (ElevenLabs/OpenAI/Azure depending on settings)
- Outbound phone call tooling via ElevenLabs "ConvAI" endpoints (approval gated)

Code:
- Voice service: `src/electron/voice/VoiceService.ts`
- Phone call tool: `src/electron/agent/tools/voice-call-tools.ts`

### 11. Extensions (Plugin System)

There is a plugin/extension system scaffolded to load `cowork.plugin.json` manifests.
Treat this as **experimental** until the project formally documents/commits to the plugin ABI.

Code:
- Registry/loader/types: `src/electron/extensions/`

### 12. Mission Control (Agent Roles, Heartbeats, Standups, Task Board)

Mission Control is the in-app control surface for managing multiple agent roles and operational workflows:
- Agent roles (persona/model/tool restrictions)
- Heartbeats (scheduled "check-in" runs per agent role)
- Standup reports (daily summaries generated from task state)
- Task subscriptions (agents "watching" tasks/threads)
- Task board (columns/priorities/labels)
- Agentic Tribe (multi-agent collaboration with shared checklists, synchronized run context, and coordinated execution)
- Performance reviews (ratings + autonomy-level recommendations for agent roles)

Key code:
- IPC handlers: `src/electron/ipc/mission-control-handlers.ts`, `src/electron/ipc/handlers.ts`
- Repos/services: `src/electron/agents/`, `src/electron/reports/StandupReportService.ts`, `src/electron/activity/`
- UI: `src/renderer/components/MissionControlPanel.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/AgentRoleEditor.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/TaskBoard.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/StandupReportViewer.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/AgentTeamsPanel.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/AgentPerformanceReviewViewer.tsx`

### 13. Desktop Shell (Tray, Notifications, Updates)

CoWork OS includes standard "app shell" features:
- Menu bar tray icon + quick input window
- Local notification store + system notifications
- Auto-update checks and GitHub releases integration (electron-updater)

Key code:
- Tray: `src/electron/tray/TrayManager.ts`, `src/electron/tray/QuickInputWindow.ts`
- Notifications: `src/electron/notifications/`
- Updates: `src/electron/updater/update-manager.ts`

### 14. Reporting / Export (Local)

CoWork OS includes local task export utilities (intended for reporting/sharing without any "phone home" telemetry).

Key code:
- Task export: `src/electron/reports/task-export.ts`

### 15. Agentic Tribe

There is a "Tribe Lead + Members" model for agentic collaboration with a shared checklist and run lifecycle.
The tribe runtime aligns tool-calling, child-task execution, and task outcomes into a single shared state.

Docs/code:
- Contract: `docs/agent-teams-contract.md`
- Orchestrator: `src/electron/agents/AgentTeamOrchestrator.ts`
- Repos: `src/electron/agents/AgentTeam*Repository.ts`
- UI: `src/renderer/components/AgentTeamsPanel.tsx`

## Security Model (Summary)

CoWork OS is designed with **deny-wins** security policy precedence across multiple layers:
1. Global guardrails (blocked commands/patterns, allowed domains, budgets)
2. Workspace permissions (read/write/delete/shell/network)
3. Context restrictions (DM vs group)
4. Tool-specific rules
5. Workspace-level task policy: optional `agent-policy.toml` loaded from the workspace root

Key code:
- Policy engine: `src/electron/security/policy-manager.ts`
- Guardrails settings: `src/electron/guardrails/guardrail-manager.ts`
- Input/output sanitization: `src/electron/agent/security/`
- Secure settings storage: `src/electron/database/SecureSettingsRepository.ts`
- Workspace task policy parser/loaders: `src/electron/agent/agent-policy.ts`

Workspace policy (`agent-policy.toml`) controls executor behavior when present:
- Required tool families by step mode: `[required_tool_families]`
- Tool allow/deny filtering: `[tool_filters]`
- Disallowed fallback phrases: `[fallback]`
- Loop threshold overrides:
  - `[loop_thresholds.default]`
  - `[loop_thresholds.mode.<analysis_only|artifact_presence_required|mutation_required>]`
  - `[loop_thresholds.domain.<auto|code|operations|research|writing|general>]`
- Runtime hooks:
  - `[[hooks.on_pre_tool_use]]`
  - `[[hooks.on_stop_attempt]]`
  - `[[hooks.on_recovery_plan]]`

The policy file is cached by path+mtime, supports optional hooks for forced tool/input fallback and stop-attempt blocking, and logs parse/load events to task logs for observability.

Security docs:
- `docs/security/README.md`
- `SECURITY_GUIDE.md`

Entry points:
- Main process boot: `src/electron/main.ts`
- Renderer boot: `src/renderer/main.tsx`
- IPC bridge: `src/electron/preload.ts`
- Node daemon boot: `src/daemon/main.ts` (non-Electron headless)
- CLI entry: `bin/coworkd.js` (headless Electron), `bin/coworkd-node.js` (Node-only), `bin/coworkctl.js` (control client)

Headless credential import:
- When `COWORK_IMPORT_ENV_SETTINGS=1` is set, `importProcessEnvToSettings()` reads LLM and search provider keys from environment variables (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, etc.) and writes them into encrypted settings on startup. Supports `merge` (default, fill blanks only) and `overwrite` modes.
- Code: `src/electron/utils/env-migration.ts`

- Control plane: `src/electron/control-plane/`
- Cron scheduler: `src/electron/cron/`

## Data, Storage, and Persistence

### Electron `userData` directory

CoWork OS persists state under a configurable user-data directory, resolved by `getUserDataDir()` (`src/electron/utils/user-data-dir.ts`).

Resolution order:
1. `COWORK_USER_DATA_DIR` environment variable (supports `~` expansion)
2. `--user-data-dir <path>` CLI argument
3. Electron `app.getPath('userData')` (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/`)
4. Fallback: `$HOME/.cowork` (when running without Electron, e.g. Node daemon)

What is stored there (see `src/electron/database/schema.ts` migration logic):
- SQLite DB: `cowork-os.db`
- Skills (managed): `userData/skills/`
- WhatsApp auth/session data: `userData/whatsapp-auth/`
- Cron store: `userData/cron/`
- Canvas session data: `userData/canvas/`
- Notifications state: `userData/notifications/`

### Database schema (high level)

Schema creation and migrations:
- `src/electron/database/schema.ts`

Major table families (non-exhaustive):
- Tasks and execution logs: `tasks`, `task_events`, `artifacts`, `approvals`, `input_requests`
- Workspaces: `workspaces`
- Channels + gateway state: `channels`, `channel_users`, `channel_sessions`, `channel_messages`, plus queue/rate limit/audit tables
- Memory: `memories`, `memory_summaries`, `memory_settings`, `memory_embeddings`, and optional FTS tables/triggers
- Secure encrypted settings: `secure_settings`
- "Mission Control" features: `agent_roles`, `agent_mentions`, `agent_working_state`, `task_subscriptions`, `standup_reports`, etc.

### Reliability flywheel (eval + risk gates)

CoWork OS includes a reliability hardening loop that converts failures into replayable eval cases and gates risky task completions.

Core parts:
- Eval persistence model in SQLite:
  - Task metadata: `tasks.risk_level`, `tasks.eval_case_id`, `tasks.eval_run_id`
  - Eval tables: `eval_cases`, `eval_suites`, `eval_runs`, `eval_case_runs`
- Eval runtime service:
  - `src/electron/eval/EvalService.ts`
  - Baseline metrics: task success rate, tool failure rate, retries/task, approval dead-end rate, verification pass rate
- Risk scoring and tiered review gate:
  - `src/electron/eval/risk.ts`
  - `src/electron/agent/daemon.ts` completion path
  - Policy levels: `off`, `balanced`, `strict`
- Eval IPC surface:
  - `eval:listSuites`, `eval:runSuite`, `eval:getRun`, `eval:getCase`, `eval:createCaseFromTask`
  - Wired in `src/electron/ipc/handlers.ts` and `src/electron/preload.ts`
- Prompt/skill hardening:
  - Prompt section composer and token budgets: `src/electron/agent/executor-prompt-sections.ts`
  - Skill shortlist routing and injection caps: `src/electron/agent/custom-skill-loader.ts`
- CI/release enforcement:
  - PR regression policy gate: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` + `scripts/qa/enforce_eval_regression_policy.cjs`
  - Nightly hardening: `.github/workflows/nightly-hardening.yml`
  - Release hardening gate: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - Timeline completion telemetry hardening:
    - `scripts/qa/backfill_timeline_completion_telemetry.cjs`
    - `scripts/qa/enforce_timeline_reliability.cjs`

## Web Browser Mode (Planned — `--serve`)

> **Status**: Roadmap. Not yet implemented.

CoWork OS can be extended with a **Web Browser Mode** that exposes the full app UI in any web browser, without requiring the Electron desktop shell. The approach reuses all existing main-process logic and adds a thin HTTP/WebSocket API layer on top.

### Why This Approach

CoWork OS already separates concerns cleanly:

- **Renderer** (React) communicates with the main process exclusively through IPC channels defined in `src/shared/types.ts`.
- **Main process** (Node.js) handles all business logic, database, agent execution, gateways, etc.

This means the renderer never calls Node.js APIs directly — it always goes through the preload bridge. Replacing that bridge with HTTP/WebSocket calls is the lowest-cost path to browser support.

### High-Level Architecture

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   Browser (React UI)             │
│   Same components, new transport │
└────────┬─────────────────────────┘
         │  HTTP REST + WebSocket
         │  (replaces Electron IPC)
┌────────▼─────────────────────────┐
│   Node.js Server (Express/       │
│   Fastify + ws)                  │
│                                  │
│   Reuses existing:               │
│   - AgentDaemon                  │
│   - Database (SQLite)            │
│   - Gateway channels             │
│   - Tool registry                │
│   - Memory system                │
│   - MCP client/host              │
│   - Cron scheduler               │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: API Server Layer

1. Create a new entry point (e.g. `src/server/main.ts`) that boots the existing main-process services **without** Electron.
   - The Node-only daemon (`src/daemon/main.ts`) already does most of this — extend it.
2. For each IPC channel in `IPC_CHANNELS` (~100 channels), create an equivalent HTTP endpoint or WebSocket message handler.
   - `ipcMain.handle(channel, handler)` → `router.post('/api/<channel>', handler)`
   - Event subscriptions (`ipcMain.on`) → WebSocket push messages
3. Serve the Vite-built React bundle as static files from the same server.

#### Phase 2: Renderer Transport Abstraction

1. Create a transport abstraction that the renderer uses instead of `window.electronAPI`:
   ```
   // Pseudo-code
   interface Transport {
     invoke(channel: string, ...args: any[]): Promise<any>;
     on(channel: string, callback: Function): void;
   }

   // Electron mode: uses contextBridge/ipcRenderer (existing)
   // Web mode: uses fetch + WebSocket
   ```
2. Replace all `window.electronAPI.*` calls in renderer components with the transport abstraction.
3. Auto-detect environment: if `window.electronAPI` exists → Electron mode, otherwise → Web mode.

#### Phase 3: Handle Desktop-Only Features

Features that have no browser equivalent need graceful degradation:

| Feature | Browser Behavior |
|---------|-----------------|
| System tray / quick input | Not available — use the main web UI |
| Desktop screenshots (`desktopCapturer`) | Omit tool or use server-side screenshot |
| AppleScript (Calendar/Reminders) | Only works when server runs on macOS |
| `shell.openExternal` / `shell.showItemInFolder` | Open URL in new tab / download file |
| File dialogs (`dialog.showOpenDialog`) | Use `<input type="file">` |
| `safeStorage` encryption | Use server-side encryption (already handled by Node daemon) |
| Clipboard read/write | Use Clipboard API (requires HTTPS + user gesture) |
| Native notifications | Use Web Notification API (permission-based) |
| Live Canvas (separate BrowserWindow) | Render in iframe or panel |
| Auto-updater | Not applicable for web mode |

#### Phase 4: CLI Integration

Add a `--serve` flag to the existing CLI:

```bash
# Start in web mode (no Electron window)
cowork-os --serve --port 3000

# Start with both Electron window and web server
cowork-os --serve --port 3000 --with-gui
```

### What Works Unchanged

- All agent execution logic (daemon, executor, tools, guardrails)
- Database layer (SQLite, repositories)
- LLM provider integrations
- Gateway channels (Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.)
- MCP client/host
- Memory system
- Cron scheduler
- Control plane (already WebSocket-based)
- Security model (guardrails, approvals, policies)

### What the Existing Control Plane Already Provides

The control plane (`src/electron/control-plane/`) already serves a built-in web dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` with task management, approvals, and LLM configuration. Web Browser Mode would extend this into a **full-featured React UI** rather than the current minimal dashboard.

### Security Considerations

- Web mode must enforce authentication (the control plane already uses challenge-response tokens).
- HTTPS should be required for production deployments (or use Tailscale Funnel).
- CORS policies needed when UI and API are on different origins.
- Session management for multi-user scenarios.

## Keeping This File Updated (Process)

Update `docs/architecture.md` when you change:
- Supported messaging channels, channel security modes, pairing/allowlist behavior
- Tool names, tool groups, approval rules, sandboxing behavior, guardrails
- LLM/search provider support or settings
- Storage locations, DB schema, migrations, or encrypted settings categories
- Control plane protocol/ports or remote access defaults
- Cron/hooks default ports/paths or behavior
- MCP client/host behavior, registry, or built-in connectors
- Memory system behavior (retention, injection, redaction, indexing, embeddings)
- Image generation providers, visual annotation tools, or related skills

Suggested PR checklist addition (recommended policy):
- If your change is user-visible or changes defaults: include a doc update in the same PR.
