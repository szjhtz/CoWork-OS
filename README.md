### Why CoWork OS?

- **Inbox Agent** — local-first email triage with AI classification, action-needed / suggested-actions / commitments views, draft handling, follow-up creation, and background sync.
- **Digital Twin Personas** — Pre-built AI twins for every role (engineer, manager, PM, director). Heartbeat v3 keeps them cheap by default: deterministic Pulse checks run quietly, and Dispatch escalates only when signals, cadence, or manual intervention justify visible work.
- **Zero-Human Company Ops** — Configure CoWork OS as a founder-directed autonomous company shell with venture workspace kits, a dedicated Companies tab, persistent operator twins, strategic planner loops, and Mission Control ops monitoring.
- **Managed Devices** — Run and inspect tasks across saved remote machines from a dedicated Devices tab with connection controls, summaries, remote task feeds, and remote file attachment picking.
- **Automations Control Center** — A single Automations section now groups task queueing, `Subconscious`, scheduled tasks, connector-backed event triggers, webhooks, and daily briefings.
- **34 LLM provider options** — 13 built-in providers plus 21 compatible/gateway options, including Claude, OpenAI, Google, Ollama, AWS Bedrock, and OpenRouter. Bring your own keys or run local models.
- **17 messaging channels** — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams, Google Chat, Feishu/Lark, WeCom, iMessage, Signal, X, and more. Chat with your AI from anywhere.
- **44 MCP connectors** — Pre-built enterprise integrations across CRM, support, productivity, analytics, and payments, with native connector support for the most common internal surfaces.
- **18 bundled role-specific packs** — including Mobile Development, Game Development, and 5 Financial packs, with 55+ skills, in-app Plugin Store for installing community packs, remote registry, and enterprise admin policies for organization-wide control.
- **137 built-in skills** — Documents, code review, web search, image generation, cloud integrations, game development, mobile development, financial analysis, infrastructure-as-code, and more.
- **Profiles & portability** — run separate CoWork profiles with isolated app data, export/import complete profile bundles, and keep credentials, channels, skills, and sessions separated by profile.
- **Active Context sidebar** — Always-visible panel showing 44 available MCP connectors with branded Lucide icons and enabled skills, auto-refreshed every 30 seconds.
- **Agent teams** — Multi-agent collaboration with shared checklists, graph-backed runs, collaborative mode, multi-LLM synthesis, persistent teams, and ACP-targeted delegation for local or remote specialists.
- **External agent orchestration** — Discover ACP agents, delegate work to A2A-compatible remote endpoints, and keep remote calls under the same approval and policy model as other governed actions, with persisted ACP tasks, restart-safe resume, remote cancel support, and the shared orchestration graph as the runtime backbone.
- **Think With Me mode** — Socratic brainstorming that helps you clarify thinking without executing actions.
- **Chat mode** — Direct LLM chat with no tools, no step timeline, same-session follow-ups, and chat-only streaming for supported providers.
- **Build Mode** — Go from idea to working prototype with a phased canvas workflow (Concept → Plan → Scaffold → Iterate) and named checkpoints.
- **AI Playbook** — Auto-captures what worked from successful tasks and injects relevant patterns into future prompts. Repeated patterns auto-promote to governed, one-click-approvable skills via the Playbook-to-Skill pipeline.
- **Evolving Intelligence** — Unified Memory Synthesizer merges all 6 memory subsystems into a single coherent context block. Adaptive Style Engine learns your communication preferences from message patterns and feedback. Evolution Metrics dashboard quantifies improvement over time (correction rate, knowledge growth, style alignment).
- **Operator Runtime Visibility** — Task completion now shows what Cowork learned, semantic batch labels and follow-up completions stay visible, unified recall spans tasks/messages/files, persistent shell sessions preserve operator state, and model routing/fallback is visible in the UI and Mission Control.
- **Configurable fallback chains** — LLM and web-search providers can run in an explicit ordered fallback chain, including Exa for search, immediate failover on retryable provider errors, provider/model-level failover visibility in the UI, and a configurable cooldown before retrying the primary LLM route.
- **Provider-aware prompt caching** — Prompt caching is on by default for supported routes. CoWork keeps stable system sections cacheable, keeps volatile turn context out of the cached prefix, uses Anthropic automatic caching when available, falls back to explicit Claude breakpoints on OpenRouter, and derives stable OpenAI-family cache keys for GPT routes such as Azure `gpt-5.4` / `gpt-5.4-mini`.
- **Usage Insights** — Dashboard showing task stats, cost/token tracking by model, activity heatmaps, top skills, per-pack analytics, per-persona success/retry metrics, and task-result satisfaction signals.
- **ChatGPT History Import** — Import your full ChatGPT conversation history. CoWork OS instantly knows your preferences, past projects, and context — no cold start. All data stays encrypted on your machine and never leaves it.
- **Computer use (macOS)** — Native desktop control via `computer_*` tools with a single active session, safety overlay, **Esc** to abort, per-app session consent (not per click), and a Settings onboarding panel for Accessibility + Screen Recording. Prefer browser and shell tools for web and repo work; computer use is routed as a last-resort lane in policy and planning guidance. **Documentation:** [docs/computer-use.md](docs/computer-use.md).
- **Security-first** — Approval workflows, sandboxed execution, configurable guardrails, encrypted storage, and 4,500+ automated tests.
- **Structured guidance** — In plan-mode flows, the agent can pause with short multiple-choice prompts instead of ambiguous free-text follow-ups.
- **Runtime resilience** — Adaptive turn budgets, context-overflow recovery, and safe path normalization keep long-running tasks moving without silent file drift.
- **Local-first & BYOK** — Your data and API keys stay on your machine. No telemetry. No middleman.

### Ideas & Media

Stable workflow entry points for the newest high-impact capabilities.

- **Ideas panel** — curated launchpad of pre-written workflow prompts and capability-aware starting points, with deep links into common tasks.
- **Document editing sessions** — inline PDF region editing, DOCX block replacement, version browsing, and document-aware file viewing for active editing sessions.
- **Image generation** — configurable provider ordering across Gemini, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and OpenRouter.
- **Video generation** — text-to-video and image-to-video routing with polling tools and inline preview.

See [Features](docs/features.md), [Heartbeat v3](docs/heartbeat-v3.md), [Providers](docs/providers.md), and [Plugin Packs](docs/plugin-packs.md) for current runtime details.

### Latest Release

**`0.5.22`** packages the session runtime ownership split, layered permission engine, workspace rule manager, session checklist primitive, metadata-driven tool scheduling, graph-backed delegation, typed worker roles, and refreshed completion/UI surfaces into a publishable release. Start with [Release Notes 0.5.22](docs/release-notes-0.5.22.md), then [Features](docs/features.md), [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md), [Channels](docs/channels.md), and the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick Start

### Download the App

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CoWork-OS/CoWork-OS/releases/latest):

| Platform | Download | Install |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **macOS** | `.dmg` | Drag CoWork OS into Applications |
| **Windows** | `.exe` (NSIS installer) | Run the installer and follow the prompts |

> **macOS first launch:** The app is currently unsigned. On first open, macOS will block it — go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway**, or run: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/CoWork OS.app"`

> **Windows first launch:** Windows SmartScreen may show a warning for unrecognized apps. Click **More info** > **Run anyway** to proceed.

> Works out of the box — defaults to [OpenRouter's free model router](https://openrouter.ai), no API key needed.

### Or Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g cowork-os
cowork-os
```

> **Windows npm install notes:**
> - Run `npm install -g cowork-os` / `npm uninstall -g cowork-os` from `%USERPROFILE%` (or another neutral directory), **not** from `%APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\cowork-os`, to avoid `EBUSY` lock errors.
> - On Windows ARM64, first launch may take longer while native modules are rebuilt; this can run multiple fallback steps before the app opens.
> - If native rebuild fails, install [Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 (C++)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and Python 3, then retry.
> - If startup logs show `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND ... dist/renderer/index.html`, reinstall the latest package and check [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).

### Or Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoWork-OS/CoWork-OS.git
cd CoWork-OS
npm install && npm run setup
npm run build && npm run package
```

> **Windows prerequisites:** Native module setup may require [Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 (C++)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and Python 3. On Windows ARM64, setup automatically falls back to x64 Electron emulation when ARM64 native prebuilds are unavailable.
>
> `npm run setup` also installs local git hooks (`.githooks/`) including a pre-commit secret scan. If needed, reinstall hooks with `npm run hooks:install`.

See the [Development Guide](docs/development.md) for prerequisites and details.

## How It Works

1. **Create a task or start from Ideas** — Describe what you want ("organize my Downloads by file type", "create a quarterly report spreadsheet") or begin from a curated Ideas prompt. No workspace needed — a temp folder is used automatically if you don't select one.
2. **Choose a mode** — Pick **Chat**, **Execute**, **Plan**, **Analyze**, or **Verified** for the runtime behavior, then optionally toggle **Autonomous** (auto-approve actions), **Collaborative** (multi-agent perspectives), or **Multi-LLM** (compare providers with a judge) per task.
3. **Monitor execution** — Watch the real-time task timeline as the agent plans, executes, and produces artifacts. Parallel tool bursts are grouped into lane summaries, and shell commands run in a live terminal view where you can see output in real-time, stop execution, or provide input (e.g. `y`/`n`) directly.
4. **Respond when needed** — Destructive operations require explicit approval (unless Autonomous mode is on), and plan-mode tasks can pause for structured multiple-choice input before continuing.

## Features

### Agent Runtime

Task-based execution with dynamic re-planning, five runtime modes (Chat, Execute, Plan, Analyze, Verified) plus orchestration toggles (Autonomous, Collaborative, Multi-LLM, Think With Me), a shared turn kernel, metadata-driven tool scheduling, graph-backed delegation, typed worker roles, optional workflow-pipeline execution with per-phase model routing, agent teams with persistence, agent comparison, git worktree isolation, AI playbook, and performance reviews. [Learn more](docs/features.md#agent-capabilities)

Skills now follow an additive runtime model: CoWork can proactively shortlist or apply a relevant skill, but the original task remains canonical. Skills add context and scoped execution modifiers instead of replacing the task prompt. [Learn more](docs/skills-runtime-model.md)

Operator Runtime Visibility makes the runtime's learning and routing visible: task detail surfaces now show the learning progression, unified recall spans tasks/messages/files/workspace notes/memory/KG, shell sessions preserve operator state, and live routing/fallback events are surfaced in Mission Control and the task UI. [Learn more](docs/operator-runtime-visibility.md)

`Subconscious` runs now use the same runtime with stricter safeguards: they start only after memory services are initialized, write durable target-scoped artifacts under `.cowork/subconscious/`, auto-dispatch across mapped workflows, require isolated git worktrees for code-change dispatch by default, and skip non-git workspaces when isolation is required. See [Subconscious Reflective Loop](docs/subconscious-loop.md) and [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#subconscious-startup-warnings-in-development).

### Output Completion UX

Completion state and file availability are now explicit:

- **High-signal completion toast**: finished tasks with outputs show `Task complete` with filename/count and actions for **Open file**, **Show in Finder**, and **View in Files**
- **Right-sidebar focus**: if you are viewing the completed task and the panel is collapsed, the Files panel auto-opens and highlights the primary output
- **Unseen-output badge**: if completion happens in another task/view, the collapsed right-panel toggle shows a numeric badge until you open Files
- **Filename-first rows with clear location context**: Files rows stay filename-only, with output folder context shown separately (or **Workspace root**)
- **Artifact parity**: artifact-only outputs are treated the same as normal file outputs in completion toasts, timeline details, and Files panel
- **Semantic completion labels**: completed tool batches and verifier verdicts now feed the richer completion text shown in timelines, feed relays, and export surfaces

### Guided Input & Runtime Recovery

Long-running tasks now have clearer operator handoffs and stronger recovery defaults:

- **Structured input cards**: plan-mode tasks can pause with 1-3 short multiple-choice prompts, with answers captured inline in the desktop UI or via the Control Plane web dashboard
- **Adaptive turn recovery**: execute-mode tasks reserve room for a final answer, soft-stop exhausted follow-up windows, make a bounded recovery attempt before triggering a safety stop, and keep follow-up completion visible when tasks resume after the main step loop
- **Context overflow retry**: context-capacity failures trigger compaction and retry instead of immediate hard failure when the model context window is exceeded
- **Path repair**: `/workspace/...` aliases and drifted relative paths can be normalized back into the active workspace or pinned task root, with strict-fail policies available when you want hard enforcement
- **Parallel timeline lanes**: read-only tool batches render as grouped timeline rows so the UI stays readable even when searches/fetches run concurrently

### Mission Control

Centralized agent orchestration dashboard with a Kanban task board, real-time activity feed, and Heartbeat v3 monitoring for pulse, defer, dispatch, cooldown, and budget state. [Learn more](docs/mission-control.md) | [Heartbeat v3](docs/heartbeat-v3.md)

### Devices

The Devices tab turns CoWork OS into a multi-machine control surface. Save and reconnect remote CoWork nodes, inspect device summaries (activity, apps, storage, alerts, resource signals), launch tasks against a selected machine, browse that machine's remote workspaces, and attach files directly from the remote filesystem before dispatching a task. [Learn more](docs/remote-access.md)

### Automations

Automations are now organized as a first-class operating surface instead of a scattered set of settings pages. The Automations section in Settings groups Task Queue, Subconscious, Scheduled Tasks, Webhooks, Event Triggers, and Daily Briefing, and Event Triggers can now subscribe to MCP connector/resource changes in addition to channel and webhook events. The home dashboard surfaces recent automation runs so you can monitor background systems without hunting through tabs. [Learn more](docs/features.md#automations-control-center)

### Zero-Human Company Ops

CoWork OS can be configured as a founder-operated autonomous company shell: venture workspace kit context, a dedicated `Settings > Companies` control surface, persistent company-linked operator agents, Heartbeat v3 operator loops, strategic planner issue generation, and Mission Control ops monitoring. Create the company in `Companies`, activate operator twins such as `Company Planner` and `Founder Office Operator`, then run and monitor the company loop from Mission Control. [Learn more](docs/zero-human-company.md) | [Heartbeat v3](docs/heartbeat-v3.md)

### Digital Twin Personas

Role-specific AI twins that proactively handle cognitive overhead. Pick a template (Software Engineer, Engineering Manager, Product Manager, VP, Founder Office Operator, Company Planner, and more), customize it, and activate — Heartbeat v3 runs cheap non-LLM Pulse checks by default, evaluates proactive cadence and checklist state, and only Dispatches into suggestions, tasks, runbooks, or cron handoff when justified. Built-in templates span engineering, management, product, data, operations, and venture/operator roles, and can now be persistently linked to a company for company-aware operations. [Learn more](docs/digital-twins.md) | [Heartbeat v3](docs/heartbeat-v3.md)

### Live Canvas & Build Mode

Agent-driven visual workspace for interactive HTML/CSS/JS content, data visualization, and iterative image annotation. **Build Mode** adds a phased idea-to-prototype workflow with named checkpoints and revert support. [Learn more](docs/live-canvas.md)

### Multichannel Gateway

Unified AI gateway across 17 channels with security modes, rate limiting, ambient mode, scheduled tasks, and chat commands. Slack now supports multiple workspaces, Telegram supports group-routing policies and allowlists, Discord can be limited to specific guilds, and Feishu/Lark plus WeCom are now first-class channels. [Learn more](docs/channels.md)

### Inbox Agent

Local-first inbox workspace that turns email into an action queue. It keeps cached mail visible on restart, syncs in the background, and surfaces the right next step for each thread: triage, draft, cleanup, commitment tracking, and scheduling. [Learn more](docs/inbox-agent.md)

- **Action cards**: Unread, Action Needed, Suggested Actions, Open Commitments
- **Mailbox views**: Inbox, Sent, All, plus Recent/Priority sorting
- **Workflow buttons**: Cleanup, Follow-up, Prep thread, Extract todos, Schedule, Refresh intel
- **Draft handling**: Send or discard generated replies before anything is posted externally
- **Commitment tracking**: Accept commitments into real follow-up tasks, then mark them done or dismiss them
- **Background sync**: Load from the local database immediately and refresh in the background without blanking the inbox on restart

### Infrastructure

Built-in cloud infrastructure tools — no external processes or MCP servers needed. The agent can spin up sandboxes, register domains, and make payments natively.

- **Cloud Sandboxes (E2B)**: Create, manage, and execute commands in isolated Linux VMs. Expose ports, read/write files — all from natural language.
- **Domain Registration (Namecheap)**: Search available domains, register, and manage DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT).
- **Crypto Wallet**: Built-in USDC wallet on Base network. Auto-generated, encrypted in OS keychain. Balance displayed in sidebar.
- **x402 Payments**: Machine-to-machine HTTP payment protocol. Agent can pay for API access automatically with EIP-712 signed USDC transactions (requires approval).

All infrastructure operations that involve spending (domain registration, x402 payments) require explicit user approval. Configure in **Settings** > **Infrastructure**. [Learn more](docs/features.md#infrastructure)

### Web Scraping

Advanced web scraping powered by [Scrapling](https://github.com/D4Vinci/Scrapling) with anti-bot bypass, stealth browsing, and structured data extraction. Three fetcher modes — fast HTTP with TLS fingerprinting, stealth with Cloudflare bypass, and full Playwright browser. Includes batch scraping, persistent sessions, proxy support, and five built-in skills (web scraper, price tracker, site mapper, lead scraper, content monitor). Configure in **Settings** > **Web Scraping**. [Learn more](docs/features.md#web-scraping-scrapling)

### Integrations

- **Cloud Storage**: 6 integrations, including Notion, Box, OneDrive, Google Workspace, Dropbox, and SharePoint
- **44 MCP Connectors**: pre-built enterprise integrations for CRM, support, productivity, analytics, and payments (Salesforce, Jira, HubSpot, Zendesk, Stripe, Tavily, Grafana, Metabase, Socket, and more), with connector notifications available as trigger inputs for automations
- **Developer Tools**: `glob`/`grep`/`edit_file`, Playwright browser automation, MCP client/host/registry

[Learn more](docs/features.md)

### Active Context Sidebar

Real-time overview of your active integrations, always visible in the right panel. Shows connected MCP connectors (44 available) and native integrations with branded Lucide icons (HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Workspace, Discord, GitHub, Postgres, and more) and green status dots, plus enabled skills from active packs. Each section shows 4 items with internal scrolling for more. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. [Learn more](docs/plugin-packs.md#context-panel)

### Usage Insights

Dashboard with task metrics, cost/token tracking by model, prompt-cache read telemetry (`cachedTokens` and cache-read rate where available), activity heatmaps (day-of-week and hourly), top skills usage, per-pack analytics, persona-level success/retry/cost breakdowns, and task-result thumbs up/down quality signals with 7/14/30-day period selection. Access from **Settings** > **Usage Insights**. [Learn more](docs/features.md#usage-insights)

### LLM Providers

34 provider options, with 13 built-in providers and 21 compatible/gateway providers. Use cloud APIs or run fully offline with Ollama, configure an ordered fallback chain for runtime failover, and get default-on prompt caching on supported Claude and GPT-style routes. Claude supports both direct API keys and Claude subscription tokens from `claude setup-token`, with live **Refresh Models** support in Settings. [Learn more](docs/providers.md)

### Plugin Platform & Customize

Unified plugin platform with 18 bundled role-specific packs (Engineering, DevOps, Product, Sales, QA, Finance, and more), each bundling skills, agent roles, connectors, and "Try asking" prompts. Packs can link to Digital Twin personas for proactive background work.

- **Search & filter**: Real-time sidebar search across pack names, descriptions, categories, and skill names
- **Per-skill control**: Enable or disable individual skills within a pack without toggling the whole pack
- **Persistent toggles**: Pack and skill states survive app restarts
- **Update detection**: Background version checks against the registry with visual indicators
- **"Try asking" in chat**: Empty chat shows randomized prompt suggestions from active packs
- **Plugin Store**: In-app marketplace for browsing, installing (Git/URL), and scaffolding custom packs, now with install-time security scanning and quarantine handling for imported packs
- **Skill Store & external skills**: Desktop GUI support for CoWork Registry skills, direct ClawHub installs, and generic external skill imports from Git repos, raw manifests, and `SKILL.md` bundles, with managed scan reports and quarantine for unsafe imports
- **External skill directories**: Add shared read-only skill folders without importing or copying those skills into CoWork's managed directory
- **Remote Registry**: Community pack catalog with search and category filtering
- **Admin Policies**: Organization-level controls — allow/block/require packs, restrict installations, set agent limits, distribute org-managed packs from a shared directory
- **Per-pack analytics**: Usage Insights dashboard groups skill usage by parent pack

Access from **Settings** > **Customize**. [Learn more](docs/plugin-packs.md)

### Best-Fit Workflows

CoWork OS ships purpose-built packs and Tier-1 connectors for three operational lanes where governed AI delivery has the clearest ROI:

| Lane | Pack | Connectors |
|------|------|------------|
| **Support Ops** | Customer Support Pack | Zendesk, ServiceNow |
| **IT Ops** | DevOps Pack | ServiceNow, Jira, Linear |
| **Sales Ops** | Sales CRM Pack | HubSpot, Salesforce |

These are the workflows where approval gates, local data control, and measurable outcome delivery pay off most — and where CoWork OS is a vendor-swap-friendly alternative to point solutions or BPO tooling. [Learn more](docs/best-fit-workflows.md)

### Extensibility

- **137 built-in skills** across developer, productivity, communication, documents, game development, mobile development, financial analysis, infrastructure-as-code, and more
- **Custom skills** in `~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/skills/` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\cowork-os\skills\` (Windows)
- **18 bundled plugin packs** with 55+ role-specific skills and Digital Twin integration
- **Plugin Store** — browse, install from Git/URL, scaffold custom packs, and review quarantine/report state for imported packs
- **Skill Store** — browse CoWork Registry skills, search ClawHub, import external skills from Git, raw JSON, or raw `SKILL.md`, and review quarantine/report state for imported skills
- **MCP support** — client, host, and registry

### Voice Mode

Text-to-speech (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Web Speech API), speech-to-text (Whisper), and outbound phone calls. [Learn more](docs/features.md#voice-mode)

### Knowledge Graph

Built-in structured entity and relationship memory backed by SQLite. The agent builds a knowledge graph of your workspace — people, projects, technologies, services, and their relationships — with 9 dedicated tools, FTS5 search, multi-hop graph traversal, auto-extraction from task results, and confidence scoring with decay. [Learn more](docs/knowledge-graph.md)

### Memory & Context

Persistent memory with privacy protection, FTS5 search, LLM compression, and a contract-driven workspace kit (`.cowork/`) for durable human-edited context. The workspace kit now separates workspace-wide files such as `AGENTS.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `RULES.md`, `VIBES.md`, and `LORE.md` from project-scoped files such as `.cowork/projects/<projectId>/CONTEXT.md` and `.cowork/projects/<projectId>/ACCESS.md`. Special files get dedicated lifecycle handling: `BOOTSTRAP.md` is a one-time onboarding checklist tracked through `.cowork/workspace-state.json`, while `HEARTBEAT.md` is reserved for recurring Heartbeat v3 checklist work instead of general task context.

Every tracked file follows a shared parser/linter model with freshness windows, secret detection, missing-file status, and revision snapshots stored under `.cowork/**/.history/`. Workspace kit health is surfaced in the app and can be checked locally with `npm run kit:lint` for human-readable output or JSON export. **Import your ChatGPT history** to eliminate the cold-start problem — CoWork OS knows you from day one. All imported data is stored locally and encrypted on your machine. **Proactive session compaction** automatically generates comprehensive structured summaries when context reaches 90% capacity — preserving user messages, decisions, file changes, errors, and pending work so the agent continues seamlessly without losing critical context. [Learn more](docs/features.md#persistent-memory-system) | [Context Compaction](docs/context-compaction.md)
